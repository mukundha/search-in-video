chapter which we are going to start is a

127
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,680
human reproduction you all know super

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,759
important chapter and from this chapter

129
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,240
you can directly expect five marker

130
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,759
majority every year you can expect a

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,880
direct five marker from this topic human

132
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,560
reproduction that can come from U

133
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Genesis or spermatogenesis or menal

134
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,919
cycle these are the most important thing

135
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,080
how to write when it is a when a five

136
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,639
marker type question comes we'll be

137
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,080
discussing everything okay

138
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
so let's start so introduction first

139
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,599
I'll be giving you introduction and

140
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,919
slowly we will be proceeding okay

141
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,599
human

142
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,479
reproduction okay tell me in humans

143
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,080
sexual reproduction occur or asexual

144
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,240
reproduction human sexual reproduction

145
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,400
occur sexual

146
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
reproduction

147
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,080
right sexual reproduction and if I talk

148
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,960
about a male male produces

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,680
sperms male produces sperm process of

150
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,120
formation of sperm is termed as

151
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,440
spermatogenesis

152
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,319
sperato

153
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,240
Genesis

154
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,919
clear sperms are there now let's talk

155
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,919
about the female female produces

156
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:45,800
egg production of the egg is termed as o

157
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,840
Genesis U

158
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,000
Genesis in total these two names they

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,479
are termed as

160
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,759
gametogenesis

161
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,319
gito Genesis

162
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,879
is so U Genesis is also gametogenesis

163
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,000
spermatogenesis is also gametogenesis

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,039
how can I say this because here these

165
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,960
are the gametes and both these gametes

166
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,400
they are

167
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,599
n right they are heid now what happens

168
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,360
next is now there is a Next Step due to

169
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,800
which there is a formation of a

170
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,639
zygote zygote the process by which

171
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,519
zygote formation occur is termed as

172
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,440
fertilization this is

173
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,279
fertilization right then what happens

174
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,920
next buddies then there is

175
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,959
development

176
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,800
development right baby will be developed

177
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
and in that particular period if I talk

178
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,920
about that period so that period again

179
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,320
I'm saying that is a 40 weeks it takes

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,720
40 weeks or the 9 month for the

181
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,680
development ultimately there is

182
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,760
paration partur means giving birth to a

183
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,880
baby students get confused between

184
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,160
paration and uh M uh micturation so that

185
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,760
is something else that is expulsion of

186
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,480
urine this is paration now listen very

187
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
carefully first male produces sperm

188
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,320
female produces egg right because of the

189
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
insemination procedure here what happens

190
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
is

191
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,160
insemination in

192
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,959
semination sperms will be introduced

193
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,200
into the female reproductive tract then

194
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,880
there will be formation of a zygote

195
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,279
right there will be formation of a

196
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,000
zygote now zygote will develop zygote

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,720
will develop now this development is 40

198
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,800
weeks you can say this is also 9 months

199
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,399
both are

200
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,680
sa 9 months or 40

201
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,680
weeks clear this is a gation period what

202
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,320
do we call this word gestation

203
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,519
period gestation

204
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,160
period and because of the various

205
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,000
hormone action there will be partur

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
isn't it clear everyone one second guys

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,040
one second something is not visible to

208
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,839
me

209
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,360
1

210
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
second one

211
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,880
second

212
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,440
okay okay now it everything is

213
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,240
fine okay so this is human reproduction

214
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,600
spermatogenesis U Genesis so what all

215
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
things are there let's have a look there

216
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
is a

217
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,839
gametogenesis now suppose this question

218
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,040
comes in your paper as a one marker

219
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
right Define gametogenesis how will you

220
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,480
remind gametogenesis that is the

221
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,560
formation of

222
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,040
gamuts formation of

223
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,959
gametes see now the biggest mistake

224
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,240
which everyone does I have written over

225
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,959
here formation of gamut the reason is

226
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,959
here I am teaching you right and it's a

227
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,399
marathon session and you know I have to

228
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,200
teach everything so I cannot give a full

229
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
definition so what are you going to

230
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,320
write because it will be a theory paper

231
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,800
you'll be judged on the basis of what

232
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
you have written on that paper you're

233
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
going to write down gametogenesis it is

234
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,760
the process of formation of a gamut

235
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,079
complete sentence you have to write down

236
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,800
if you will write like this you will not

237
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,399
get complete marks okay now formation of

238
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,040
gamuts they are of two type when we talk

239
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,160
about female it is the U

240
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,399
Genesis and when we talk about a male it

241
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,959
is the spermato

242
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,720
Genesis

243
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,720
perat

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,959
Genesis clear now moving on to the next

245
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,120
is

246
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,200
insemination now insemination what is

247
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,800
insemination who is genital track

248
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
reproductive track yes same same same

249
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,279
someb now tell me tell me tell me tell

250
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,040
me insemination so insemination means

251
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,040
deposition

252
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,480
of you're going to again I'm saying

253
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,560
you're going to write the whole

254
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,279
definition deposition of

255
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,920
sperms

256
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,279
in female

257
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,480
reproductive

258
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,120
track clear female reproductive track

259
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,440
done done done buddies next is

260
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,279
fertilization that means Fusion

261
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,839
of

262
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,040
male

263
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,560
and

264
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,560
female

265
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,800
yamit next implantation very important

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,760
word what is implantation very nice good

267
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,279
buddies good job good job doing good now

268
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,320
next is implantation what is

269
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,720
implantation that means how can you

270
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,240
explain implantation implantation means

271
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,360
whenever we have a zygote zygote comes

272
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,279
to a stage which you will learn later on

273
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,399
that is a blastos so blastos engrave

274
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,480
itself into the uterine wall yes

275
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,680
attachment of blastos to the uterine

276
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
wall very nice good

277
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,760
job

278
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,760
attachment

279
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
of

280
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:55,839
plastoy

281
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,440
to uterine

282
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
wall blasty now you'll say ma'am what is

283
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,279
blastocyst BET blasty is what blastocyst

284
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,240
is one of the stages Whenever there is

285
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,519
an embryo development this implant

286
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,440
itself and whenever this implantation

287
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,360
occur in many female there is

288
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
implantation bleeding in many cases it's

289
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,920
not that visible in many cases it is

290
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,759
visible whenever there's an implantation

291
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,800
some blood comes out right so gestation

292
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,399
so what do you mean by gestation on

293
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,320
gestation how time period of development

294
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,160
of embryo in

295
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,639
uterus gestation

296
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,639
period

297
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,639
embryo

298
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,720
development

299
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
in

300
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,680
uterus right

301
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,160
partur

302
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,519
that means now you're going to write

303
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,880
down again I'm saying the full

304
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,320
definition giving

305
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
birth

306
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,360
to

307
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,360
fully

308
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,959
developed

309
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,959
fetus when the baby is fully developed

310
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,839
in that case we call this as a bation

311
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,040
one second buddies I have to switch on

312
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,839
the okay clear yes quick birth yes

313
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,120
pation okay D done hope these points are

314
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,240
clear now guys let's move on on to the

315
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
next one now buddies we are going to

316
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,279
start with one by one so first of all we

317
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,199
are going to start with the male

318
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,959
reproductive system right so let's start

319
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,600
with a male reproductive

320
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,639
system okay so let's

321
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,519
start mail

322
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,759
reproductive

323
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,759
system male reproductive system so first

324
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,800
of all we are going to discuss the male

325
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,360
reproductive

326
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,199
system clear so in the male reproductive

327
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:50,120
system you know there are various

328
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,880
structures present so along with the

329
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,480
various structures here are ducts some

330
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,440
accessory ducts yeah one second one

331
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
second Buddies

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
so what all things are part of male

333
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,799
reproductive

334
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,400
system first the

335
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,559
primary

336
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,400
reproductive organ

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,640
Le

338
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
whereas

339
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
accessory

340
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,120
structures in accessory structures we

341
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,720
are having

342
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,840
glands and

343
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,919
ducts

344
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,880
mom

345
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,840
definitely can't

346
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,600
focus okay okay okay

347
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,320
so ma'am definitely full cabus will be

348
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,919
covered in neat 50 days challenge yes

349
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,159
everything will be covered okay so here

350
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,600
we have is a primary reproductive organ

351
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
so what is the primary reproductive

352
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
organ in case of male what is that that

353
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,840
is the what is that that is the test

354
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,320
right so there is

355
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
tesus

356
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,559
along with that some other structures

357
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,280
are also there we will be discussing

358
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,240
some glands are present some glands are

359
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,280
like prostate gland is there there is a

360
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,159
semal vcle semal vcle and there is one

361
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,039
more gland which is a cers gland is

362
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,000
present there secretions they are

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,080
important for overall development of

364
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,240
gamuts yes now next one we are having is

365
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,559
the other structure okay now let's

366
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,880
start first we are going to start with

367
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,600
the test now testes are situated outside

368
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
the abdominal cavity within a pouch

369
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,600
which is termed as scrotum

370
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,120
right yes so testes are situated outside

371
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,280
the abdominal cavity testes they are

372
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,559
present in a sack now these sacks they

373
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,559
are termed as scotle

374
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,039
sack scotle sack

375
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,919
why they are present outside because

376
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,200
they maintain a temperature of a body

377
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,919
less than 2 to 2.5 de C which is

378
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,679
important for the process of sperm

379
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,000
development right now the scrotum helps

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,159
in maintaining the low temperature of

381
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,559
testes 2 to 2.5 de lower than the normal

382
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,679
internal temperature necessary for the

383
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,720
spermatogenesis now whenever a baby is

384
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,640
there whenever a male baby uh you know a

385
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,679
kid is there so in that case when a

386
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,640
child develops at the time of birth the

387
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,960
tesus they descend into the scrotum many

388
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,159
cases test they unable to descend into

389
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,360
the scrotum they remain inside in the

390
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,720
abdominal cavity that condition is

391
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,440
termed as

392
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,480
cryptorchidism that is that condition is

393
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,760
termed as cryptorchidism so with the

394
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,240
help of a surgical way so tesus will be

395
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,000
descended into the scrotum because when

396
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,280
tesus will remain inside the body in the

397
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,440
abdominal cavity there will be Pro there

398
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,120
will be you know the spermatogenesis

399
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,799
proper sperm formation will not be able

400
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,840
to occur right now in adult each test is

401
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,880
oval in shape each test is oval in shape

402
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
shape is oval now next is with a length

403
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,760
of around 4 to 5 so they are having the

404
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,320
length of around 4 to 5 cm see we are

405
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,280
just discussing important points because

406
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,000
it will be a theory paper so we have to

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,919
write down everything that is the reason

408
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,640
I am giving you all the points now width

409
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,200
is about 2 to 3 cm so their width is

410
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,279
around 2 to 3 cm with the help of cords

411
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,440
they are

412
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,240
attached with the help of the cords they

413
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,400
are attached so that I'm not discussing

414
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,000
here now the test is covered with a

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
dense covering here outermost covering

416
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,799
is quite dense so that is the reason so

417
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,200
they are having a different covering yes

418
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,400
inguinal Canal is there gobul is there

419
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,120
which helps in holding the test clear

420
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,520
now next is they're having a dense

421
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,480
covering around it now next is each

422
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,559
testes has about 250 compartment called

423
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,120
testicular lobules now let's understand

424
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,559
this let's understand this okay now here

425
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:56,000
can you see can you see this is a very

426
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,360
important diagram previous diagram again

427
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,799
I'm saying no need to remember but this

428
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,919
diagram is super important you have to

429
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,720
draw this diagram once in your notebook

430
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,000
why this is important because here

431
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,320
question can comes relate come related

432
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,880
to the duct like what kind of duct is

433
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,200
present what is the flow of a sperm from

434
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,840
where does it travel Etc and Etc now

435
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,919
let's start now if I talk about the

436
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,279
testes so this is how a test is I'm just

437
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,080
making a this a one one side one okay

438
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,440
okay this is outermost covering tuna

439
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,559
alenia is there in fact three layers are

440
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,840
there not mentioned your in your

441
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,679
ncrt C here 250 compartments are present

442
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,799
they have compartments like this just

443
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,360
like that of a kidney here also

444
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,840
testicular lobules are present what do

445
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,320
we call

446
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,120
this

447
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,640
testic lobules

448
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,919
see I'll show you everything I will show

449
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,640
you see here come here what we have

450
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
discussed so far each testes has

451
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,600
compartment termed as testicular lobules

452
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,279
how many 250 testicular lobules are

453
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,320
present how many

454
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,760
250 testicular lobules are

455
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,000
present now in testicular lobules

456
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
seminiferous tubules are present here

457
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,320
here tube like structure 2 to three

458
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,080
seminiferous Tu tube tube again I'm

459
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
saying what are I'm labeling

460
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
seminiferous

461
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,200
tubules sem

462
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,080
mineras tules here I'm writing tules are

463
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,799
present now these seminiferous tubules

464
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,600
are the places where there is sperm

465
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,360
synthesis okay now similarly over here

466
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,240
also it will be

467
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,880
present here also so it will be present

468
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,600
so they are present like

469
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,960
this they can be one they can be two or

470
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,000
they can be three now this point is

471
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
clear done now listen here very

472
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,360
carefully now another diagram which is

473
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,400
there in your ncrt is this and many

474
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
student that they get confused and they

475
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,559
say k ma'am this is a seminiferous Tibu

476
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,000
and what you are drawing is a

477
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,960
seminiferous tubules like a tube what is

478
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
the difference so this is actually

479
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,279
whenever you take a tube and whenever

480
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,080
you dissect it what you will get is the

481
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,840
round structure so what are these These

482
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,840
are the seminiferous tubules and in the

483
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
seminiferous tubules the sperms are

484
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,000
present in the various stages of

485
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,200
development sperms are present in

486
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
various stages of development done clear

487
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,200
everyone okay okay so let's start so

488
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,960
what comes after the seminiferous

489
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,840
tubules so in the seminiferous tubules

490
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,080
sperms formation occur isn't it clear

491
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,440
now from here the sperm enter into a

492
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,279
network of

493
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,480
tibule what is that come on tell

494
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,520
me what is that come on what's the name

495
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,760
of

496
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,679
that what's the name of

497
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,840
that come on tell me tell me R test is

498
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,440
absolutely right that is a r test T So

499
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,080
this I'm labeling as R

500
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,600
testis after that sperm goes into small

501
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,240
ducts which are termed as come on write

502
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,559
down the

503
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,159
name come on write down the name what is

504
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,919
that vas differentia yes so next comes

505
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:52,760
the vas

506
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,679
differentia so here

507
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,440
come the vas efferentia so this I'm

508
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,919
labeling as

509
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,919
Vasa

510
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,840
differentia now these things are not

511
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,880
clearly mentioned in this diagram but

512
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,520
again I'm saying you can see testic

513
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,120
lobules out of this testicular lobules

514
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,799
the r tesus comes out R testis say sperm

515
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,640
will go into the Vasa inferentia some

516
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,360
network of tubes you can see over here

517
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
then the sperm will enter into

518
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,240
epididymis so it is having a structure

519
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,080
like this epididymis epididymis is

520
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,200
present from the upper part of the test

521
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,480
to the lower part means it is the one

522
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,960
which spread on the One Direction of a

523
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,240
test this is termed as

524
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,240
epididymis clear epid diis the reason

525
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,080
why I'm having both these images on your

526
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,039
screen is I can you have to draw this

527
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,679
diagram but I'm explaining you

528
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,200
everything over here so that you can

529
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,039
have a clear comparison see now what

530
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,600
happens is now here now now the here the

531
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,120
sperm will enter all the way into the

532
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,559
another duct this duct is tered as vast

533
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,520
difference Vasa difference or vast

534
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,000
difference clear now can I explain you

535
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,600
some other

536
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,440
thing clear is this point clear now

537
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,559
listen very carefully there are many

538
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,679
cases where the vast difference is

539
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:40,840
absent so what do you think are they

540
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,480
able to produce their own baby can they

541
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
have their own baby if both the vast

542
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,919
difference is absent if both the vast

543
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,440
difference is

544
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,640
absent tell me tell me they can have

545
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,919
their own babies how so no no vast

546
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,600
difference can be abset that is is

547
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,399
termed as congenital bilateral absence

548
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,640
of vast difference that is cbavd

549
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,559
congenital bilateral absence of vast

550
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,200
difference and when there is absence of

551
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,640
vast difference they can have their own

552
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,080
babies also by with the help of a

553
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,320
surgical procedure sperm they take out

554
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,760
from the testicular lobules sperms will

555
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,080
be taken out and then the fertilization

556
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
they can do it externally that means

557
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,000
with the help of an IVF procedure they

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,960
can have their own babies right so this

559
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
yes this can also happen vast difference

560
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,080
can be absent so that means in the the

561
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,440
their body sperms are being synthesized

562
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,159
but they are not coming

563
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,840
out can clear now the vast difference

564
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,559
now come back to this diagram buddies

565
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,440
here testicular luse next is R testes

566
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,840
then vas differentia then the epididymis

567
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,600
see epididymis is like

568
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,279
this right it has three different part

569
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,000
no need to remember that because this is

570
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,440
not mentioned in the book now next we

571
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,200
are having is a vast difference can you

572
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
see this vast difference this is a vast

573
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,279
difference coming over here this is on

574
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,039
the one side another side also another

575
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,480
uh these are coming these are also the

576
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,399
same thing will happen on the another

577
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:10,080
side also now here what happens is guys

578
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,440
again I'm saying this diagram is

579
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,640
important and this diagram should be

580
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,200
there in your

581
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,559
notebook now here now first there are

582
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,320
different glands they will open over

583
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,679
here first gland name is a semal vcle

584
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,760
second is the prostate gland and third

585
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,159
is a bulbo ureal gland they have their

586
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:27,960
own

587
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,720
secretion clear now ultimately sperm

588
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,880
coming over here urine can also come

589
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,600
over here right are you getting this

590
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,880
point sperm travel all the way over here

591
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,360
all the way they will be having

592
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,399
secretion of a semal vcle the prostate

593
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,760
the bulbo ureal gland and what are their

594
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,320
secretion that I'll let you know now we

595
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,399
in case of male there is a common

596
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,519
opening common thing right because that

597
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,279
carries the urine coming from the

598
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,480
urinary Blader so they are having a

599
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,159
common thing which is termed as urra and

600
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,720
this is also termed as urinogenital

601
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,559
duct this is

602
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,320
urino

603
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,519
genital

604
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,120
duct urinogenital duct so it carries

605
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,880
urine also it carries a sperm also clear

606
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,240
now next one here what happens is now

607
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,840
sperm comes out this is termed as Ural

608
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,519
me like from here the sperms come out

609
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,080
here you will see the P penis is present

610
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,559
the covering is termed as a for skin the

611
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,519
swollen portion over here that is termed

612
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,120
as a gland

613
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,440
spenis done now now now now listen very

614
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,240
carefully now let's talk about the

615
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
glands right simultaneously we will be

616
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,559
discussing everything okay now first

617
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,640
thing is let's talk about the gland

618
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,159
first gland is prostate gland second

619
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,080
gland is a seminal vicle the next is the

620
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,039
bulbo ureal the cers gland now out of

621
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,200
all these three gland which of the

622
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,679
following is unpaired one very important

623
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,440
question what is that that is the

624
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,039
prostate is

625
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,080
unpaired prostate is unpaired rest semal

626
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,760
vicle bulbo urethal they are paired this

627
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,720
is

628
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,720
unpaired first thing you have to start

629
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,880
with a let's start with semal vcle this

630
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
is one pair present on both the sides

631
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,200
situated behind the urinary blader

632
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,240
provide secrete fructose prosta gland in

633
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,559
vitamin C citric acid and

634
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,320
ocol clear yes so this is the one now

635
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,480
fructose why fructose is important

636
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,639
fructose gives energy for the developing

637
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,960
sperm right so this is you know this is

638
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,159
a carbohydrate so this will provide the

639
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,399
energy prostag glands they will be

640
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,360
important for the motility later on they

641
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,200
are important for the motility which you

642
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,000
will learn I'll tell you how okay now

643
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,880
next thing is bulbo next let's talk

644
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,840
about the prostate because after semal

645
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,799
there will be position of a prostate it

646
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,480
is a chestn shape Chestnut shape

647
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,919
unpaired milky

648
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,639
appearance calcium ion it secrete

649
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,120
calcium ion protic enzyme citric acid

650
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,559
semal plasmine are there so you know the

651
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,320
whsh is because of that milky appearance

652
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,440
is because of the secretion by the

653
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,080
prostate gland which is

654
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,760
unpaired it is having citric acid it is

655
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,840
having the semal plasmine which makes it

656
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,279
thick you know whenever it comes out of

657
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,000
the body it becomes thick the reason is

658
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,399
because of the secretion of a prostrate

659
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,360
gland now next one is a bulbo ureal

660
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,240
gland the last one this is again one

661
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,039
pair it secrete mucus it helps in

662
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,480
lubrication palbo urethal another name

663
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,120
is cers gland everyone will learn this

664
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,559
okay clear everyone now let's move on

665
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,559
further

666
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,000
so right duct whilea part is done right

667
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,679
duct I have explained you now here now

668
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,279
let's talk about the tesus in detail so

669
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,080
this is a cross-section cross-section of

670
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,799
What Not testicular lobule this is a

671
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,399
cross-section of a semi iferous tibule

672
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,880
clear so this is a TS of

673
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,880
seminiferous

674
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,159
tibule seminiferous tubule so those

675
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,880
tubes you

676
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,679
remember 1 2 3 they can be pres they

677
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,320
will are present in testicular lules I'm

678
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,120
talking about those so here you will see

679
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,519
the sperms are present in various stages

680
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,600
of

681
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,200
development if you look at this diagram

682
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,799
you have your ncrt open if this diagram

683
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,480
is not clearly visible to you you can

684
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,240
open your ncrt in that you will see

685
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,199
outer cells are rounded in

686
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,960
shape and towards the center you will

687
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,839
find the sperms are present because

688
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,960
outer side the

689
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,639
spermatogonia are

690
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,199
present

691
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,879
spermogonia

692
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:30,079
SP atonia in the center sperms are

693
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,079
present spermatozoa are present so this

694
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,280
is how they develop from Outer to

695
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,040
Inner outer to Inner clear now again

696
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,159
this is an important diagram first

697
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,480
diagram was the male reproductive system

698
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,679
diagram here from male reproductive

699
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,679
system question can come related to the

700
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,918
gland where is this gland present is it

701
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,639
paired what are the secretion Etc and

702
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,320
Etc now from this topic question can

703
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,560
come transfer section of uh draw the

704
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,400
transfer section of sem tribute super

705
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,200
duper

706
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,000
important yes some tanu samak

707
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,880
everyone what is your next exam biolog

708
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,839
what is your next exam

709
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,920
buddies what's the name of your next

710
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,920
exam that's a physical education

711
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,839
exam what the for that the my students

712
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,800
they are always ready H isn't it

713
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,520
it so dedicate this dat to

714
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,079
biology

715
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,040
okay let's

716
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,720
start now let's do a quick reading of

717
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,200
the duct male accessory duct including

718
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,920
the r testes vasen idamis and the VAS

719
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,119
Defence okay clear now can you tell me

720
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,599
no it's not tough it will be easy don't

721
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,839
worry can you tell me the function of

722
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,240
epididymis here what is the function of

723
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,640
epididymis what is the function of aamus

724
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,880
who's going to tell

725
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,640
me what do you want me to repeat dream

726
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,119
doctor what should I

727
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,599
repeat yes it stores sperms other than

728
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,200
that it helps in providing the motility

729
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,319
also to the sperm before this sperms are

730
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:31,359
not motile motility they attain in the

731
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,040
epididymus okay now next one last line

732
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,839
what was the last line I just talked

733
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:41,480
about the this one buddy okay okay now

734
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,319
next is sanifer tubules of the re testes

735
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,599
open into vast differential theor test

736
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:49,079
everything is there why why notes are

737
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,440
there on your screen because it will be

738
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,560
a theory paper you will be writing

739
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,800
everything for this

740
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,119
paper now V differentia leave the tesus

741
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,359
open into epidemis located along with

742
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,040
the posterior surface of each tesus

743
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,280
epidemis lead to vast Defence that

744
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,160
Ascend to the abdominal Loop over the

745
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,640
urinary

746
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,400
bladder okay now

747
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,480
buddies everyone right down in comment

748
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,960
section the flow of sperm starting from

749
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,359
the sem feris tubules come on write down

750
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,520
in comment section sperm moves from

751
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,680
seminiferous tibule to dash two dash two

752
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,520
dash two dash everything right

753
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,440
now come

754
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,839
on this is for cbsc this is for your

755
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,240
board this is for come on write down

756
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,359
write down starting from the semer

757
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,440
tubule you have to start with the

758
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,920
seminiferous tubule like this semer

759
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,920
tubule very nice Raj sem to reest to

760
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,400
vast differentia very nice epidemis and

761
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
vast difference very nice and after that

762
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,280
vast difference the semal vcle will uh

763
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,200
flow will you know secretion will enter

764
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,800
then there will be ejaculatory duct

765
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,880
there will be prostate cers gland

766
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,480
ultimately into the urinogenital duct

767
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,200
and from the uh further it comes

768
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,520
out okay clear

769
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,560
very nice good job good job clear now

770
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,319
let's proceed

771
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:41,160
further this also we have done now let's

772
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,599
talk about the penis the penis is a male

773
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,200
external genitalia figure is given at

774
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,520
the back the madeup of special tissue

775
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,240
that helps in erection of penis to

776
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,640
facilitate the insemination the enlarged

777
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,960
end of penis is termed as glance penis

778
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,119
is covered by by lose fold of skin which

779
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:01,599
is termed as four skin done clear good

780
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,520
job good job Shan Monga yes to urra very

781
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,440
nice

782
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,760
okay now let's move on to the sperm

783
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
sperm so next topic now let's talk about

784
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,599
the sperm then I'll be talking about the

785
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,079
process of spermatogenesis microscopic

786
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,000
structure if I let's come back to this

787
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,240
diagram let's understand with the help

788
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,599
of this diagram okay again everyone you

789
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,079
have your notebook draw this diagram

790
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,079
draw the diagram structure of sperm here

791
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,079
okay f for say let's draw the diagram of

792
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,200
sperms in your notebook everyone start

793
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,079
drawing you are watching this session so

794
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,680
make a full advantage of it you were

795
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,560
revising everything and after that like

796
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
in between the session whenever I told

797
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,960
tell you guys that you have to draw a

798
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,400
diagram do that it will be a great help

799
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,520
for you because ultimately when you will

800
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,599
be drawing the diagram in your board

801
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,000
paper that will be like second time or

802
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,160
the third time time you're drawing so

803
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,280
you'll be able to draw within a very

804
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,920
less duration of time so here if I talk

805
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,040
about the sperm sperm is having

806
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,079
Following part first part is termed as

807
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,079
head second part is the neck then there

808
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:13,319
is a middle

809
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:16,839
piece middle

810
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,839
piece

811
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:20,880
middle

812
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,000
piece and ultimately there is a tail

813
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,359
what is this this is a tail

814
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,119
done head neck middle piece tail so if

815
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,359
you look at the body body is covered by

816
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:36,720
the plasma membrane the body is covered

817
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,520
by the plasma whole body is covered by

818
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,680
the plasma

819
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,440
membrane clear now next one is the

820
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,119
acrosome acrosome here acrosome acrosome

821
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,079
yes absolutely right acrosome is derived

822
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,960
from GGI

823
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,240
body there derived from GGY

824
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,599
body and this is the one which is filled

825
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,640
with acrosomal

826
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,920
enzyme acrosomal

827
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,240
enzyme right these acrosomal enzymes are

828
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,760
zalin

829
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,839
these acrosomal enzyme are

830
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,240
honas acrosomal enzyme are Corona

831
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,160
penetrating

832
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,880
enzyme

833
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,880
penetrating

834
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,560
enzymes three

835
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,920
enzymes clear now next one after that

836
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,400
you will find the nucle cleus having the

837
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,720
chromosomal material here the chromosome

838
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,760
here they are having n n that means they

839
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,720
are

840
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,240
hloy they are

841
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,280
hloy right so in the head part you will

842
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,599
find the acrosome is there the nucleus

843
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,480
is there right then there is a neck neck

844
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,520
neck may you will find PC now this is

845
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,000
not pryanka chobra here you will find

846
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,160
here the proximal

847
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Centrio

848
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,200
proximal

849
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,599
Centrio and

850
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,400
DC distal

851
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,480
cental cental is

852
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,640
there proximal cental and distal cental

853
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,680
from this Centrio the flagala

854
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,480
arise okay so next is a middle piece in

855
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,760
the middle piece you will find

856
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,160
mitochondria is there which is the

857
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,119
energy used for the swim and then there

858
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,319
is a tail which helps in the

859
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,200
movement Right movement of

860
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,280
sperm clear is this point

861
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,440
clear no no no no no head um the neck

862
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,240
mitochondria is not present in the

863
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,040
middle piece region this one region the

864
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,359
mitochondria the spiral shaped

865
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,520
mitochondria is

866
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,079
present clear clear

867
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,800
okay yes it is present in in the body

868
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,839
now moving on to the

869
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,280
next one

870
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,200
second

871
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,200
now

872
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,359
okay one second so yes moving on to the

873
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,960
next let's talk about spermatogenesis

874
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,520
let's complete the spermatogenesis you

875
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,760
want to complete the spermatogenesis

876
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,960
now okay so let's complete the

877
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,119
spermatogenesis right now here first of

878
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:05,319
all we will complete this spermato

879
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,800
Genesis so so what is a spermatogenesis

880
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,440
spermatogenesis is formation of

881
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,440
sperm formation of

882
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,200
sperm

883
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,280
from

884
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,960
sperm Mother

885
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,520
cell mother's cell or

886
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,520
spermatogonia

887
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,280
spermatogonia clear point clear now

888
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,040
there are listen here then I like

889
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,680
explain you the ncrt diagram now there

890
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,200
are

891
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,880
spermatogonia

892
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,760
spermatogonia now these spermatogonia

893
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,880
they are arranged in the periphery of

894
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,640
the sanus tubu clear done now here

895
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,559
spermatogonia lots of spermatogonia are

896
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:20,920
present right they undergo the process

897
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,880
of

898
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,960
mitosis they undergo the process of M

899
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,119
mitosis with the help of mitosis what

900
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:31,599
they form is primary

901
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,040


902
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,359
spite right spermatogonia are

903
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:45,920
2N so what will be the ploy of primary

904
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,359
 come on write down in the comment

905
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,240
section come on come on yes that's an

906
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,520
equational division but write down in

907
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,319
the comment section by the time let me

908
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:54,880
drink water come

909
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,880
on

910
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,240
come

911
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,599
on if this is 2N what will be the pyy of

912
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,200
the primary spermato site 2N yes

913
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,480
absolutely right so this will also be 2N

914
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,559
done now this primary now what

915
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,240
the student do in the paper they make

916
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,640
this silly mistake key they start the

917
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,960
meosis in the spermatogonia no

918
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,119
spermatogonia first of all divide and

919
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,599
mature and what they form is primary

920
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,119
 so primary will undergo

921
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,240
the process of meosis so meosis occurs

922
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,400
in two step meosis one and what they

923
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,640
form is secondary

924
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,880
 secondary

925
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,079
spermato

926
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,280
site right secondary will be n

927
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,400
isn't it

928
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,760
yes or no yes this will be n now this

929
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
will undergo

930
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,559
the spermed

931
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,440
formation formatted now this is by the

932
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,880
meosis 2 everybody start writing the

933
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,319
reason is more you will write more it

934
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:17,599
will be helpful for you again I'm saying

935
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,359
buddies start write also simultaneously

936
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:22,480
it's it's a good revision thing for you

937
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,640
see when I was in class 12th I was not

938
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,359
having this opportunity of watching some

939
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:28,280
Marathon sessions some classes where

940
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,280
everything is there in a one shot but

941
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,119
you you guys are seriously very lucky

942
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,880
that you are getting everything it just

943
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,359
that you just have to sit and

944
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,160
study yes okay so spermatic so here

945
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,319
these are n and these will also be n now

946
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:48,680
one primary will form two

947
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,520
secondary spermato site will form to

948
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,599
will form the four secondary spermed

949
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,280
this is a reductional Division and this

950
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,400
is a equational division clear done now

951
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,559
these spermed they will

952
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,720
differentiate they will differentiate

953
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,079
and they will form the mature sperms

954
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,319
only differentiation is there so this

955
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,680
will also be n

956
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,520
differentiate per met Genesis formation

957
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,079
of sperm from a Meto from a mother cell

958
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,240
spermatogonia next is process process

959
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,760
sperms are formed now here the pro

960
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,359
formation of sperms from spermed this is

961
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,480
termed as

962
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,760
spermiogenesis what is this this is the

963
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,400
spermiogenesis

964
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,440
pero oh

965
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,440
oh

966
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,880
spermiogenesis okay so spermatogonia

967
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,720
primary secondary

968
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,400
spermatites and the sperm this is the

969
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,920
spermiogenesis and this is the

970
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,839
spermatogenesis now head of the sperms

971
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:10,799
they are present in the ctoi cells okay

972
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:12,599
I have to explain C cells also that is

973
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,680
also left I'll explain you

974
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,000
so head of

975
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,559
spur are associate ated

976
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,799
with C

977
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,359
cells and their

978
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,119
release is called as

979
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,520
permeation is termed as

980
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,079
permeation

981
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,960
clear everybody tell me tell me tell me

982
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,680
is this point clear any doubt to anyone

983
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,400
amongst please let me know come on come

984
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,040
on come on come

985
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,160
on come

986
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,880
on come

987
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,319
on do it

988
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,920
fast

989
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,040
yes

990
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,280
come on come on come on spermatids to

991
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,200
spermatozoid spermiogenesis very nice

992
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,160
very nice

993
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,480
everyone okay now if this question comes

994
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,040
in your paper you have to draw this a

995
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,640
diagram this very nice neat and clean

996
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,319
diagram of flow chart in fact and you

997
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,240
have to explain everything

998
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,240
okay

999
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,520
okay okay now one more thing is left

1000
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,319
let's discuss

1001
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,760
this so one more thing CI cells CI cells

1002
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,920
are present

1003
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,200
here which provide nutritions to

1004
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,920
nutrition to the developing

1005
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,640
sperms here outside in the interstitial

1006
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,480
space some special cells are present

1007
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,359
which are termed as interstitial cells

1008
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:29,280
or ladc cells these are the leic

1009
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,960
cells or

1010
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,960
interal

1011
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,880
cells and what is the function of leic

1012
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,760
cells LC cells secret hormone

1013
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,040
testosterone what does it secrete

1014
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,400
testosterone and testosterone is the one

1015
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,280
which is responsible for the secondary

1016
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,359
sexual characteristics in case of

1017
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,359
male

1018
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,799
clear now now let's talk about this

1019
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:06,000
diagram but say let's complete this

1020
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,359
where is the diagram here so this is a

1021
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,160
closer view of the seminiferous tibule

1022
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,760
you will see here spermatogonia are

1023
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,599
present which form the primary

1024
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,799
which form the secondary and

1025
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:22,599
ultimately spermatites are formed and in

1026
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:24,440
the Lum in the center they form the

1027
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,160
sperms you will see sometimes their head

1028
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,119
they are associated with the CI cells

1029
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,079
their head is associated with CI cells

1030
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,720
because they gain nutrition from there

1031
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,119
and their release is termed as

1032
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,079
spermiation so three words we have

1033
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,240
learned so far spermatogenesis

1034
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,880
spermiogenesis and spermiation so you

1035
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,760
should know the difference between these

1036
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,960
three okay now let's talk about hormonal

1037
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,640
control

1038
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,680
hormonal control of of

1039
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,079
spermatogenesis now this topic you all

1040
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:09,520
must have done in the class 11th also

1041
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,440
the chemical coordination and

1042
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,920
integration chapter same thing I am

1043
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,400
repeating here nothing new the same

1044
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,359
thing I'm repeating here here let's

1045
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,440
start with the

1046
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,400
hypothalamus yes hypothalamus is a

1047
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,200
structure which controls the

1048
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,440
spermatogenesis hypothalamus secretes a

1049
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,079
hormone which is

1050
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,280
GnRH this GNR goes to anterior

1051
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,000
pitutary and anterior pituitary in this

1052
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,680
respect they secrete to hormone one is

1053
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,920
the

1054
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,359
FSH and second one is LH FS is I'm

1055
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:53,680
writing the full form for you buddies

1056
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,160
follicular stimul

1057
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,640
ating

1058
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,640
stimulating

1059
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:09,839
hormone and this is leutinizing

1060
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,760
hormone leutinizing hormon see it will

1061
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,799
be too important for you for for the

1062
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:19,799
board examinations again I'm saying FSH

1063
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,640
now FSH will go to the ctoi

1064
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,319
cell C holy cells it will produce

1065
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:35,680
factors produce

1066
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,559
factors important for

1067
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,480
spermatogenesis detail not

1068
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,839
given which are important for the

1069
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,119
spermatogenesis so ultimately they

1070
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:57,079
provide nutrient

1071
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,240
right now next one is a lutenizing

1072
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,079
hormone lutenizing hormone they help in

1073
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:05,240
providing the what do they do they

1074
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,920
secrete

1075
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,119
Androgen they secrete

1076
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:17,520
Androgen and androgen is the

1077
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:27,000
testosterone clear this is the

1078
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,640
then why are you studying here you can

1079
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,599
go you can go in case you don't want to

1080
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,920
study then go so no one is telling you

1081
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,480
to come here uh see we are not forcing

1082
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,160
you question hypop yes zamb that was a

1083
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,240
hypop fisal bort circulation

1084
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,039
right okay clear is this point clear to

1085
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,400
all my

1086
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,359
bodies basically ctoi cells produce

1087
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,160
factor which are important for the sper

1088
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,520
Genesis and specifically buddies if I

1089
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,839
say specifically for the spermiogenesis

1090
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,839
is May the main process

1091
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,119
spermiogenesis spermiogenesis

1092
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,839
spermiogenesis may it plays a role

1093
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:11,799
specifically if I say clear so

1094
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:14,359
spermiogenesis spermed so sperm

1095
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:16,400
conversion conversion mate is

1096
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,440
important okay okay then done done now

1097
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,640
let's move towards the female

1098
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,920
reproductive system

1099
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,720
female reproductive system okay so let's

1100
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,839
start with the female reproductive

1101
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:33,880
system buddies any doubt till now yes or

1102
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,799
no come on let me

1103
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,319
know

1104
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:49,400
female

1105
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,400
reproductive

1106
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,920
system

1107
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,280
so in female reproductive system what

1108
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,000
all structures are present come on tell

1109
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,920
me female reproductive system the

1110
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,720
ovaries are there female accessory gland

1111
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:11,839
cervix

1112
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,760
ovaries female accessory

1113
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:23,280
glands accessory glands are

1114
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,799
there there is

1115
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:31,319
cervix cervix is also a part and other

1116
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:35,680
than that the external

1117
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,760
genitalia

1118
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,760
external

1119
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:47,440
genitalia these are the different part

1120
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,960
clear ovaries you all know the are the

1121
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,680
these are the one which are responsible

1122
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,480
for the formation of egg first let's

1123
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,440
start with this external genitalia first

1124
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,400
I'll be explaining you the external

1125
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,559
genitalia then we will be proceeding

1126
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,559
further right so external

1127
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:06,240
genitalia now external genitalia the

1128
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,760
diagram here the things are not clear

1129
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,240
properly so here different parts are

1130
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,079
there let's have a look

1131
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,720
so

1132
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,760
okay so there is a kushy structure here

1133
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,640
which is termed as the mo

1134
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,720
pubis Kush structure is the mo pubis

1135
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,960
which is covered with here full of it's

1136
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,160
a Kush fatty next one is I'm labeling it

1137
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,920
here that is the labia

1138
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,720
maora

1139
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:59,920
maora inner lip is termed as liia

1140
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,960
minora minora

1141
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,520
clear

1142
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,280
here just like that of a gland spanis

1143
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,640
females they have

1144
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,400
clitoris Cloris is there right here

1145
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,359
ureal

1146
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,160
meatus one second

1147
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,880
second urra opening urethal meatus is

1148
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,160
there and vaginal oriface is

1149
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,119
there so this is the

1150
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,799
ureal

1151
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:47,079
oriface and this is the

1152
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:50,079
vaginal

1153
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,000
opening is

1154
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,599
present clear so so there is a mons

1155
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,520
pubis again I'm explaining there is a

1156
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,119
mons pubis there is a labia majora laia

1157
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,559
minora urethal ores vaginal opening they

1158
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:10,039
are present clear now now

1159
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:14,960
now around the urra par Ural glands are

1160
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,520
present some glands some glands right

1161
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,160
around urra par ureal glands are

1162
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,799
present par

1163
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:28,200
ureal

1164
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,400
gland par ureal gland their secretion

1165
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,960
helps in neutralizing the

1166
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,599
urine other than that what's the name of

1167
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,079
the next gland Bartholin gland some very

1168
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:47,119
nice next is Bartholin gland

1169
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,079
present barolin gland and Bartholin

1170
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,520
gland is present

1171
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,680
around

1172
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,119
vaginal

1173
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:00,839
opening opening and what does it secrete

1174
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:02,880
it secrete

1175
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,359
mucus what does it secrete it secrete

1176
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:09,200
mucus which helps in

1177
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,280
lubrication okay clear is this point

1178
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,319
clear to all of you

1179
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,079
buddies right now ovaries are there

1180
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,720
cervix you know cervix is a part next is

1181
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,200
a external genitalia mons fubis there is

1182
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,960
a Mia maora inside labia manora mon

1183
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,520
pubis Majora minora at the junction

1184
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,200
there is a clutoris center paroral gland

1185
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,359
there is a vaginal opening here there

1186
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,160
will be anal opening look at this

1187
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,039
diagram here also things are given but

1188
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:41,359
not properly here you will see labia

1189
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,559
maora is given labia maora and minora

1190
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,920
they are labeled over here vaginal ores

1191
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,640
is given urra is also opening over here

1192
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,400
there's a pubic symphisis urinary

1193
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,599
bladder Addus there will be rectum

1194
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,440
cervix Etc

1195
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:01,000
right okay yes yes what's the doubt

1196
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,760
what's the doubt tell me doubt doubt

1197
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,119
down don't spam guys don't spam okay so

1198
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,799
what's the doubt what what doubt you

1199
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:14,640
have okay now let's proceed by the time

1200
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,200
uh let's proceed towards this right if

1201
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,520
you have any doubt you can write down in

1202
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,680
the comment

1203
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,640
section

1204
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,839
now this is a diagrammatic

1205
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,680
representation this is not an external

1206
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,559
genitalia this is a diagrammatic

1207
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:30,279
representation of the female

1208
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,279
reproductive system internally right so

1209
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:35,640
here different structures are present

1210
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,200
the first structure is the uterus guys

1211
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,680
can you see this

1212
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,440
structure this structure this is a

1213
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,119
uterus what is this this is a uterus is

1214
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,440
it labeled

1215
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,279
here I'll label this this is our

1216
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:53,520
uterus here the three layers of uterus

1217
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,359
are present

1218
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,440
uh no bet it's an English Channel so I

1219
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,720
have to lubric uh mucus is the one which

1220
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,200
helps in the lubrication basically so

1221
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,119
that easy insemination can occur

1222
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,000
okay okay okay who asked this question

1223
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,240
bike bike

1224
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Walla okay so let's start so here uterus

1225
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,920
three coverings are present first

1226
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,079
covering is the outermost covering which

1227
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:29,880
is a perimeter perimetrium which is

1228
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,480
present towards the outer side then in

1229
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,559
the middle there is a myometrium

1230
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,520
myometrium is made up of smooth

1231
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,640
muscles smooth muscles and these smooth

1232
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,319
muscles rigorous contraction helps in

1233
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:49,200
Easy birth of a baby okay then the inner

1234
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,839
layer which is endometrium which show

1235
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,000
periodic shedding the inner layer shed

1236
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,039
it always shed monthly shedding what

1237
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:02,160
does it show it show monthly

1238
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,640
shedding and because of the monthly

1239
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,000
shedding we experience female experience

1240
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,480
menal

1241
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,799
cycle clear cyclic changes is because of

1242
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:16,480
the endometrium right so this is so they

1243
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,200
form a cavity over here cavity this is a

1244
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,599
uterine cavity labeled here this is a

1245
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,520
uterine fundus part the thicker part is

1246
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,760
a fundus part so two hand like structure

1247
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,480
as I've discussed earlier some ducts are

1248
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,920
also present some hand-like structure

1249
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,160
they arise and these hand like structure

1250
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,680
they are the fallopian tube fallopian

1251
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,640
tube one fallopian tube

1252
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:43,680
two right now these fallopian tube has

1253
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,760
different part it is having isus ampula

1254
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,200
and infantum three different part is

1255
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,839
there okay now who's going to tell me

1256
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,920
where does the fertilization occur very

1257
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,480
important question fertilization occur

1258
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,319
in

1259
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,200
fertilization occur

1260
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,760
in

1261
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,279
dash where does fertilization occur

1262
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:15,119
ampula very nice just me it occurs in

1263
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,079
ampula it occurs in

1264
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,279
ampula right ampul at this region so

1265
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:23,720
here you will see here ovaries are

1266
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,319
attached ovaries are not directly

1267
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,960
attached to the uterine wall many

1268
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,520
student when they make this diagram they

1269
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,720
say ma'am they attached over here no

1270
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,039
they're not attached to the uterine wall

1271
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:39,760
in fact they are here in the cavity

1272
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,720
they're present in the cavity right so

1273
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,520
here ovaries they release egg eggs will

1274
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,559
be captured by infundibulum infundibulum

1275
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:52,359
is having a finger like finger like

1276
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:54,480
projections if you will see it's the

1277
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,599
finger like projections are like this

1278
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:59,119
and if you will see here there is a hole

1279
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,599
present hole hole hole which is tered as

1280
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:05,640
ampula so egg once it is released from

1281
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,480
the ovary they will come over here in

1282
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,359
this osteum so once they will enter over

1283
01:06:10,359 --> 01:06:12,520
here they will reach at the ampula

1284
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,240
region they will wait for the ampula

1285
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,599
they will wait for the sperm to come if

1286
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:19,039
copulation will occur sperm will be

1287
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,720
released into the vagina from sperm

1288
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,720
sperm Will Travel Travel Travel it will

1289
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,599
come here in the ampula and in the

1290
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,119
ampula it will undergo the

1291
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:30,559
fertilization right so where does the

1292
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,960
fertilization occur correct answer is it

1293
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,760
occurs in the ampula region where does

1294
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,079
it occur in the ampula region done

1295
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:44,160
clear that's a ampula

1296
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,160
ampula ampula it's a pipe now so it has

1297
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,720
to enter in a pipe how will they enter

1298
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,480
into the

1299
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,000
pipe yes

1300
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,160
why all not population because the egg

1301
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,799
has a life egg is released in a

1302
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,880
particular time period it is released

1303
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,839
that I'll show you menal cycle K day 14

1304
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:12,000
per it is released and add the day 14 to

1305
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,559
it is having a life of around 24 hours

1306
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,760
so 24 hours May it will die so that is

1307
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,119
the reason all copulation will not lead

1308
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,400
to

1309
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,000
pregnancy is that it clear egg will be

1310
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,640
released once in a month at the day 14

1311
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,359
it will be viable just for 24

1312
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,559
hours

1313
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,680
okay now next is here let's proceed

1314
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,760
towards the towards here now these two

1315
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,119
points are clear now here you will see

1316
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:42,200
the cervix is present cervix this was

1317
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,359
the part cervix is present cervix and

1318
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,680
vagina is present cervix and vagina they

1319
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,119
form a cervical Canal so they form a

1320
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:52,920
canal over here through which the sperm

1321
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,720
enter

1322
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,520
okay clear

1323
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,240
everyone okay

1324
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,880
so let's proceed now let's look at the

1325
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,559
structure of a ovary where is the

1326
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:10,720
structure of a ovary

1327
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,480
yeah ovary ovary how many ovaries do we

1328
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,359
have we have two ovaries in case of

1329
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,839
birds there is a single

1330
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:23,439
ovary right in case of bird there is a

1331
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,839
single ovary why because that's an

1332
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,000
adaptation to flight here in case of

1333
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,920
female two ovaries are present now if

1334
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,799
you will look over here here a thin

1335
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,640
membrane thin covering is present thin

1336
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,080
covering germal epithelium thin covering

1337
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,120
is present thin covering is present

1338
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,679
clear here the eggs are present in

1339
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,399
various stages of development yes the

1340
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,640
shape is alond like here the blood

1341
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,799
vessel nerve Supply everything is there

1342
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,439
which provide nutrition

1343
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:56,640
here you will find the follicles are

1344
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,759
there in various stages of development

1345
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,799
primary follicle will be present the

1346
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:04,679
secondary follicle will be present

1347
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:07,520
secondary there will be tery follicles

1348
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,439
also there will be gfriend that means

1349
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:12,560
graffian follicle also so graffian

1350
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,319
follicle is a follicle which is a mature

1351
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,319
follicle which is a mature follicle

1352
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,600
through which the eggs they will release

1353
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,238
Here the mature egg they will come out

1354
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:25,920
whatever is Left Behind that is termed

1355
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,520
as this see what they releases a egg a

1356
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,920
worm they releases whatever is Left

1357
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,920
Behind that is termed as Corpus lutetium

1358
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,640
which is a temporary endocrine gland

1359
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,480
what is this this is a

1360
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,400
temporary endocrine

1361
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:51,080
gland temporary endocrine gland clear

1362
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,799
what does it secrete it secrete

1363
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,679
progesterone and and

1364
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:58,640
estrogen clear now here this yellow

1365
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,800
color body is converted into a white

1366
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,520
body which is termed as Corpus

1367
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,000
alons Corpus

1368
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,199
alons which is just like a scar white

1369
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:14,960
body clear so eggs are there in the

1370
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,400
various stages of development we have a

1371
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,679
pair of

1372
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:21,840
ovaries clear now here one more thing is

1373
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
labeled that is a entrum entrum is the

1374
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,239
empty space so they have this cavity

1375
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:30,800
which is the entrum so as they develop

1376
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,080
tery follicle start showing the

1377
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,679
formation of antrum which is completely

1378
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,040
formed when we talk about the graffian

1379
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,760
follicle

1380
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,719
clear okay

1381
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,840
now let's move

1382
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,719
further okay okay okay now buddies let's

1383
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:55,840
do

1384
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,120
the this one the U Genesis okay let's do

1385
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,520
U Genesis F say

1386
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,000
Okay

1387
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,159
gametogenesis o

1388
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,960
Genesis o Genesis so just like that of a

1389
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,400
sperm spermatogenesis where there's a

1390
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,719
formation of sperm o Genesis this is the

1391
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,640
formation

1392
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,120
of of

1393
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,880
egg or

1394
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
oite

1395
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,280
from egg Mother

1396
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,400
cell egg Mother cell egg Mother cell

1397
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,040
which is also to termed as

1398
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,360
ugia or

1399
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,679
gonium clear oite now o Genesis is a

1400
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,840
stepbystep procedure but this is not a

1401
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,840
continuous process this is a

1402
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,840
discontinuous

1403
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,960
process discontinous

1404
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,480
process when does it start it start

1405
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,120
before

1406
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,520
birth before birth spermatogenesis

1407
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,840
starts at puberty and it never ends but

1408
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,280
here if I talk about

1409
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,320
this it

1410
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,760
end at

1411
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,239
menus now what do you mean by menus

1412
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:42,520
menus is a play you know at particular

1413
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,440
time period when there is no menal cycle

1414
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,320
when menal cycle stops it stops

1415
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,239
clear

1416
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:55,440
now it occurs in two different step

1417
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,440
one let's start here first I'll be

1418
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,480
explaining you this this I'll explain

1419
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,920
you this CH one which is there in your

1420
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,679
ncrt then I'll explain you the follicles

1421
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,360
also

1422
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,159
see millions of ugia now whatever I'm

1423
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,440
discussing here that is related to your

1424
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,840
uh ncrt millions of ugia are present

1425
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,760
when a child is there in the mother's

1426
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,360
swm how many

1427
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,199
ugia

1428
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,159
clear ugona how many millions they are

1429
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:31,080
present when I was four month gestation

1430
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,199
when just imagine when my mother was

1431
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,520
pregnant and I was there in her wom and

1432
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,239
I was just 4 month old that gestation

1433
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:41,000
while four-month-old not after birth

1434
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,320
whilea four four-month-old in that

1435
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:47,400
particular time in my ovaries the eggs

1436
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,400
that means ugia were present in

1437
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,920
millions and they keep on dividing they

1438
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,520
keep on dividing right they keep on

1439
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,280
dividing clear now listen very carefully

1440
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,480
so they divide and what they form is

1441
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,880
primary oite when during the fetal life

1442
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,679
during the fetal

1443
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:12,320
life yes

1444
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:23,840
clear so primary oite right so it this

1445
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,600
primary oite the primary oite now this

1446
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,320
primary oite start dividing right it

1447
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,520
undergo the miotic division completed

1448
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,199
prior to

1449
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,280
ovulation ugas are there ugas they will

1450
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,760
divide and they will form the primary

1451
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,080
oite now this primary oite they will

1452
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,719
start dividing they will start dividing

1453
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:48,639
and prior to the

1454
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:51,800
ovulation they stop see I I'll explain

1455
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,920
you here so let's start

1456
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,920
right so let's start with U

1457
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,920
Genesis

1458
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,960
ugona what are these

1459
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,159
honia ugia billions of ugas are there

1460
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,239
now these ugia they divide by

1461
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:18,480
mitosis and they differentiate

1462
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:21,880
also differentiate

1463
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,960
also clear

1464
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,840
and what do they form

1465
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,639
is primary

1466
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,760
oite primary

1467
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,679
oite clear now they will divide further

1468
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:46,800
C they will start the process of meosis

1469
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,159
one meosis one they will start the

1470
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:53,040
earlier it was mitosis now it is meosis

1471
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,239
now now meosis

1472
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,320
one it will halt at it will start meosis

1473
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,920
but it will halt it will stop and where

1474
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,280
does it stop it stop at prophase right

1475
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:15,199
it will stop at proas

1476
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,960
one

1477
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,960
tipline

1478
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,120
stage

1479
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,520
right so this is before birth this is

1480
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,239
primary oite only these are what these

1481
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:33,600
are the primary oite so they have

1482
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,520
started they have started the procedure

1483
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,000
but they have not divided so again we

1484
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,199
call it as primary

1485
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,560
oite we call it as primary

1486
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,960
oite we call it as primary

1487
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,080
oite

1488
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:57,920
right clear

1489
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,239
now now in this primary usid stage now

1490
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,840
what happens is this is a fetal life now

1491
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,000
what will happen this is again I'm

1492
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
writing this is the fetal life when

1493
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,920
child is there in mother's

1494
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:19,560
form up now what will happen baby

1495
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,320
born baby I was born baby born

1496
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,679
one right these primary oite they will

1497
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:31,159
remain like

1498
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:36,760
this primary oite will remain like this

1499
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,080
they are already

1500
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,120
arrested at proac

1501
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:48,639
one arrested at proas one ditin

1502
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,679
stage clear right they will wait

1503
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,960
they will not complete the division they

1504
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:02,080
will wait so at menal

1505
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:08,239
cycle menal cycle the first menal cycle

1506
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:11,679
that is a mear now this primary oite

1507
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,800
will divide now let's have a look

1508
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,440
primary

1509
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,600
oite

1510
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,679
oite this was the primary oite now this

1511
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:24,960
Prim primary oite will divide and it

1512
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,639
will form the secondary

1513
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:34,440
oite it will form the secondary

1514
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:38,480
oite right as they divide the division

1515
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,239
is unequal division is unequal the

1516
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,199
another one is very small the smaller

1517
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:49,719
one is termed as the first polar

1518
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:54,120
body first polar body

1519
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,360
body what is this this is a first polar

1520
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,000
body which is of no use because this is

1521
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,199
a result of a unequal division now what

1522
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:05,840
happens is secondary oite will this one

1523
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,920
will divide further because it is a

1524
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,679
result here they have completed the

1525
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:10,960
meosis

1526
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,800
one here they have completed the meosis

1527
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,480
one meosis one is done so definitely it

1528
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,920
will be n okay it will be 2 N now they

1529
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,320
will divide further now before dividing

1530
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,480
again listen very carefully it will

1531
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,159
remain like this but it it will start

1532
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:30,600
meosis

1533
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:37,280
to meosis 2 but again it will arrest

1534
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,239
at metaphase

1535
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:47,639
2 metaphase 2 not metaphase 1 metaphase

1536
01:19:47,639 --> 01:19:51,560
2 so this is a process first arrest was

1537
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,520
here when the child was there in the

1538
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,080
mother's swarm ditin stage prophase one

1539
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:00,280
second arrest was at this stage that is

1540
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,120
at the metaphase any doubt okay okay

1541
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,159
I'll repeat

1542
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:08,320
this generative cells vegetative cells

1543
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,040
here we are discussing zoology and no

1544
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,159
not

1545
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,800
botney yeah tell me I'll repeat this

1546
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,120
again see now do not focus here first

1547
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,560
listen to me listen to me I'm giving you

1548
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,440
my example when I was was there in my

1549
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,920
mother's SW right I was just a four

1550
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,880
month four month gestation period honia

1551
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,120
millions of ugas they start developing

1552
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,280
now these ugia which was there in my

1553
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,800
ovaries they start dividing they form

1554
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,159
the primary oite how do the primary oite

1555
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,159
formation occur by a mitosis now this

1556
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:50,639
primary oite started the process of

1557
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:53,840
meosis they started so so when does me

1558
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,760
when does o Genesis start o Genesis

1559
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,600
start when a child is there in the

1560
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,159
mother's womb so proace one started so

1561
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:04,480
as the proace one started it is halted

1562
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,600
at the ditin stage okay so now they are

1563
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,280
halted at a ditin stage now these

1564
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:14,960
primary oite stuck in the Diplo te stage

1565
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,960
they will remain like this and I was

1566
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,040
born I was 12 to 13 years old they

1567
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,600
remain like this their number reduces

1568
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,880
your ncrt says their number reduces that

1569
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,280
is termed as arraia the death of these

1570
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,040
oite some oite die out of those Millions

1571
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:40,639
only 60 to 80,000 per OV was there in

1572
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:41,480
the

1573
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,560
ovary was there in each ovary right so

1574
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,840
60 to 80,000 number now primary oite

1575
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,080
they were waiting so when I got my first

1576
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,000
menal cycle listen very carefully I'm

1577
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,760
taking my example example so when I

1578
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,800
started my first menal cycle I was

1579
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,080
around 13 years old I don't remember now

1580
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,960
so that primary oite started the process

1581
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,840
of meosis

1582
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,159
1 it was already started but now they

1583
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,760
have completed they completed the

1584
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,120
process of meosis one whenever there is

1585
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,400
a first division one cell formed the two

1586
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,120
cell this here this was a unequal

1587
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,080
division unequal division means one was

1588
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,400
a smaller cells other was a bigger cell

1589
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,639
smaller cell is termed as a first polar

1590
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,440
body the bigger cell is a secondary oite

1591
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,760
now secondary oite will start dividing

1592
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,560
secondary oite will form the will

1593
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,960
undergo the meosis 2 but meosis 2 as he

1594
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,280
had started the meosis 2 it will be

1595
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,880
stuck it will complete the prophase 2

1596
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,840
but it will be stuck at the metaphase

1597
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,520
2 now what will happen I'll come here

1598
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,080
and I'll show

1599
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,600
you now this is the mature this is this

1600
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,239
is a secondary oite now our graffian

1601
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,760
follicle will release that secondary

1602
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,600
oite secondary oite arrested at

1603
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,520
metaphase 2 it is released now come

1604
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,800
here as it is

1605
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,280
released it will come over here from the

1606
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,320
infundibulum it will wait for the wait

1607
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,760
at the Ula waiting at the Ula population

1608
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,360
happened firms are here now sperms they

1609
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,760
will travel travel they will come to the

1610
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,600
ampula now sperms will be responsible

1611
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,480
for conversion of the secondary oite

1612
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,920
into oted or aom that means it will

1613
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,440
complete the meosis 2 so when sperm will

1614
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,880
come then only it will complete the

1615
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,960
meosis 2 otherwise it will not complete

1616
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,080
the meosis

1617
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,080
to

1618
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,679
White done no meal cycle is the toughest

1619
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:52,000
no it's not tough It's easiest I'll show

1620
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,679
you how

1621
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,000
done everyone clear so this point is

1622
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,400
clear CH tell me if it is clear yes or

1623
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,560
no come

1624
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,040
on say tell me then we will start the

1625
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:08,560
next topic that is a menal cycle come

1626
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:13,120
on done

1627
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:16,120
everyone come on come on come on JY say

1628
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,639
come on tell

1629
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,360
me

1630
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,000
Al be S white done great great great

1631
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,840
good job buddy simultaneously hope

1632
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,199
you're writing also AB how many diagrams

1633
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,600
you have done you have drawn the diagram

1634
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,040
of uh sperm in your

1635
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,280
notebook duct the male male diagram hope

1636
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,920
that is also clear we have drawn the

1637
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,760
structure of OV that is also again I'm

1638
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,960
saying this chapter is important now

1639
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,159
you'll say ma'am every chapter is

1640
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,679
important but this chapter for five

1641
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,520
markers they are important okay that is

1642
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,159
the reason this is the first chapter I

1643
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:07,719
am starting and this will take some time

1644
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:09,760
to complete because I am trying to

1645
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,920
explain you everything CH suppose a

1646
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,159
topic comes related to U Genesis now how

1647
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:17,080
you're going to write down first you're

1648
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,639
going to Define what is a u Genesis when

1649
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:22,360
does it start when does it end and then

1650
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,119
then you will make a chart you're not

1651
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:26,679
going to write the stories you're going

1652
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:28,239
to make the chart that one cell divided

1653
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,280
into two second cell third cell uh

1654
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:34,560
everything and everything okay

1655
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,960
clear no it will not be a great it will

1656
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,719
not be a issue I have given you a

1657
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:44,400
solution this is how you can draw okay

1658
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,600
do not focus here okay from now onwards

1659
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,639
buddies if during the revision you will

1660
01:25:49,639 --> 01:25:51,880
not focus on these two diagram you will

1661
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,920
focus on this diagram everything I've

1662
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,760
explained you all the points and this

1663
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,560
one this one see o Genesis o Genesis is

1664
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,719
done that's it I've explained you

1665
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,320
everything okay okay my dear buddies yes

1666
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,679
no come on tell me ad come on Sleeping

1667
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,360
Beauties get

1668
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,520
up

1669
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,159
yes enjoying enjoying everyone if yes

1670
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:24,639
then F say give me thumbs up in the

1671
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,280
comment section if you are enjoying this

1672
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,440
session see almost more than 50% of this

1673
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,320
chapter we have already done the one of

1674
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,840
the biggest chapter of class

1675
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,320
12th done so drink some water and then

1676
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,480
we will start with the menal cycle

1677
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,639
everybody drink some water good good

1678
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,639
good thank you so

1679
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,239
much very nice good good good

1680
01:26:53,239 --> 01:26:57,600
okay very nice very nice very

1681
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,400
nice okay so let's start buddies let's

1682
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,360
start with the with the with the with

1683
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,360
the topic number two which is a menal

1684
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,199
cycle

1685
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,080
okay menal

1686
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,400
cycle now suppose a question comes in

1687
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,960
your paper Define menstral cycle write

1688
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,600
down the different stages of menstral

1689
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,080
cycle CH what is a menal cycle menal

1690
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:23,440
cycle occurs in two different ways now

1691
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,199
you'll be like n n this definition we

1692
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,080
haven't studied ma'am in school we have

1693
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,679
another definition I'll explain you in a

1694
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,880
beautiful way there is one process which

1695
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,360
occur in

1696
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,119
OV there is a process which occur in the

1697
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,960
uterus this is the first time I am 100%

1698
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,480
sure like my way uh this is a f like you

1699
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,119
will be teaching this is very complete

1700
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:49,920
different I am teaching you because if

1701
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,560
you know the concept then you can write

1702
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,560
anything in your your paper okay and

1703
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,080
once you're done with this paper please

1704
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,520
let me know ma'am yes paper was good

1705
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,040
fine yes everything went well or not to

1706
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:05,040
discuss so ovary so first thing ovary so

1707
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,560
ovary during the menal cycle what

1708
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,320
happens in OV is the development of

1709
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:19,960
follicle there is development of

1710
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,360
follicle follicle

1711
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:27,400
follicles means primary

1712
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:32,080
follicle develop into the secondary one

1713
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,520
secondary develop into the ter one ter

1714
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,320
develop into a girlfriend that is a

1715
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,440
graffian follicle okay which is

1716
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,159
happening in this chart H continuous

1717
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,719
talking continuous students they are

1718
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,280
talking to each other very wrong moving

1719
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,920
on to the next is the uterus in the

1720
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,000
uterus also some changes occur there

1721
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,440
there is

1722
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,320
formation and

1723
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,119
breakdown

1724
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:05,119
and

1725
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,880
breakdown

1726
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,880
of

1727
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,320
endometrium right and these processes

1728
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,520
whatever I have mentioned over here

1729
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,840
these processes they are under

1730
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:29,239
the influence

1731
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,280
of

1732
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,239
hormones now you'll be like ma'am no

1733
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:40,920
this definition we haven't studied in

1734
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,800
school now I'll tell you see special

1735
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,000
cycle it is that cycle which occurs in

1736
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,239
uterus as well as

1737
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,360
OV this is that cycle where there is

1738
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,480
development of follicle in ovary and

1739
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,840
formation and breakdown of endometrium

1740
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,800
in the

1741
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,560
uterus the two parallel process occurs

1742
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,960
and both these process they are under

1743
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,840
the control of various

1744
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,760
hormone

1745
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,239
done characteristic

1746
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:15,159
feature

1747
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:19,639
so when does it start when do cycle

1748
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:23,840
start when it is at puberty

1749
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:28,159
12 to 14 years of age nowadays it is

1750
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,440
starting early because of adulteration

1751
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,679
because of the food which we

1752
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:35,000
eat

1753
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:41,119
right now start is termed as

1754
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,960
minarch and when does it

1755
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:50,560
stop it stop when a female is almost 50

1756
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,360
years of age

1757
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:57,719
50 55 48 like this this is termed as

1758
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:01,719
menopause it start it ends like this

1759
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:07,320
mean Arch and menop pass done

1760
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,639
okay we are teaching we are studying

1761
01:31:09,639 --> 01:31:11,960
menal cycle okay now listen very

1762
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,679
carefully very very very very very very

1763
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,159
very very

1764
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,119
carefully there are various stages of of

1765
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:26,040
meal cycle in the ovary there are

1766
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:29,560
various step first step

1767
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,800
is molecular

1768
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:43,360
phas second step is the ovulation

1769
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:53,760
phase third step is the luteal phase

1770
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:02,600
total duration of this is almost 28

1771
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:09,960
days right 1 to 13 14 day 13 days

1772
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:15,760
follicular development occur 14th

1773
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:23,679
day this occur 15 to 28

1774
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,560
today the Lal face

1775
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,719
occur right point

1776
01:32:29,719 --> 01:32:33,639
clear now let's talk about uterus uterus

1777
01:32:33,639 --> 01:32:35,800
may be there are stages now you'll say

1778
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,199
yes we haven't talked about it a uterus

1779
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:43,920
way there is the first phase that is the

1780
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,159
menstrual flow

1781
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:55,960
phase flow phase second phase is the

1782
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,960
proliferative

1783
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,760
phase proliferative

1784
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:09,119
phase third phase is the last one that

1785
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:12,440
is the secretory

1786
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,320
phase these are the faces which occur in

1787
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,800
uterus these are the faces which occur

1788
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,960
in the ovary clearly I'm explaining you

1789
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,600
everything clear now the first thing

1790
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,119
see at the day one at the day one let's

1791
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:34,800
start with the day

1792
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:41,960
one day one GNR comes from the

1793
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:46,239
hypothalamus GNR goes

1794
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,159
to better better better take now GN R

1795
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,080
gnrs come and DNR goes to the anterior

1796
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,960
pitutary interior pitutary release the

1797
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,000
hormone the follicular stimulating

1798
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,760
hormone the first step I'm first let's

1799
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,199
do with respect to this okay now FSH

1800
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:08,679
level

1801
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,119
increases FSH level increases as there

1802
01:34:14,119 --> 01:34:17,880
is increase in the FSH level follicles

1803
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:22,040
develop molecular stimulating hormone

1804
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,159
lead to the release of lead to the

1805
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:27,000
formation of follicles primary secondary

1806
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,360
tertiary

1807
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,840
Gul graan follicle clear primary

1808
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,520
secondary tertiary and the graphion

1809
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,159
follicles FSH comes FSH comes from

1810
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:41,080
anterior pit do not forget now this

1811
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,040
comes from anterior pit right FSH

1812
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:48,360
increases FSH increases because

1813
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,159
progesterone

1814
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,119
reduces and estrogen

1815
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,280
reduces how that I'll tell you later on

1816
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:59,560
okay now as the follicles

1817
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,719
develop as the follicles develop

1818
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,800
developing follicles releases estrogen

1819
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,119
so they will release estrogen

1820
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:12,440
okay they will release

1821
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,119
estrogen see you will see here estrogen

1822
01:35:16,119 --> 01:35:17,600
level

1823
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,159
increases developing follicle releases

1824
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,040
estrogen Point Clear

1825
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,600
this is the development because of this

1826
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,400
estrogen level increases now what

1827
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:32,080
happens next is here as FSH increases

1828
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,880
over here LH also increases now LH

1829
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,360
increases developing follicles FSH

1830
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,920
increases now L increases LH increases

1831
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,080
estrogen also increases because of

1832
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,400
sudden increase in estrogen L surge

1833
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,199
occur what happens is LH surge see what

1834
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:52,639
is this l

1835
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:57,480
search LH surch because of LH searge the

1836
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,679
graphion follicle kicks out the

1837
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,840
secondary oite and secondary oite is

1838
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,520
that oite which is stuck at the

1839
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,840
metaphase

1840
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,960
2 okay which is stuck at the metaphase 2

1841
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,679
now how to write in a paper that also

1842
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:14,159
I'll explain you L surge now what we

1843
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,320
have is L surge occur now we have is

1844
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,199
ovulation occur ovulation is this one

1845
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,080
ovulation done done done let's have a

1846
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,400
look follicular phase occur because of

1847
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,920
the increased level of

1848
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,679
FSH developing follicle will release

1849
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,159
estrogen estrogen increases due to which

1850
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:33,040
LH also increases L surge occur due to

1851
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,600
which the ovulation occur at the day 14

1852
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,159
everyone is everything

1853
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,520
clear now the next thing next thing next

1854
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,639
thing next thing what happens is

1855
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:46,119
whatever is left behind bachaa

1856
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:47,520
everything which is Left Behind is

1857
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,320
termed as Corpus

1858
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,920
litium and as I have discussed earlier

1859
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,840
the Corpus lium is a temporary endocrine

1860
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,440
gland what does it release progesterone

1861
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,800
and estrogen it releases progesteron and

1862
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,080
estrogen so this releases progesterone

1863
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,400
and

1864
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,520
estrogen clear next phase is termed as

1865
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:14,000
lual phase Lal means Corpus litium is

1866
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,679
there see now what is happening

1867
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,600
progesterone level increases this first

1868
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,239
there is a downfall in the estrogen then

1869
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:22,119
estrogen level also increases because of

1870
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:25,000
the Corpus lithium done this point is

1871
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,040
clear everyone now Corpus litium it is

1872
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,800
termed as a temporary because it has a

1873
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,920
life now the Corpus lithium will be

1874
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,600
coent gone we will get the Corpus aluts

1875
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,440
this is a wide

1876
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:42,599
scar Corpus elans white

1877
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,760
body

1878
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,320
Albus this point this point is

1879
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:52,159
clear right this point is is clear now

1880
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:56,040
let's move on to the uterus let's look

1881
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,760
at the steps that happens in the uterus

1882
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:01,400
so in the uterus different stages are

1883
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:05,080
there okay the first is the menal flow

1884
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,280
phase first the menal flow phase

1885
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,679
initially for some period of time 3 to 5

1886
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:14,080
days menal flow occurs menual flow means

1887
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,400
release of blood from a female track it

1888
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:20,159
comes out tissues also comes out why

1889
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:23,880
does it occur occur because of the

1890
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:27,280
downfall of progesterone and downfall of

1891
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,599
estrogen the Menses of the menual flow

1892
01:38:30,599 --> 01:38:36,920
occur clear now as the follicles develop

1893
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,080
as the follicle develop they releases

1894
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,560
estrogen as estrogen comes estrogen

1895
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,679
helps in the formation of the

1896
01:38:44,679 --> 01:38:46,560
endometrium this is endometrium so

1897
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,639
endometrium formation occur they will

1898
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:51,400
form the endometrium yes this is served

1899
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,400
as proliferative phase proliferative

1900
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,280
phase done now endometrium develops

1901
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,800
develops develops Corpus litium start

1902
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,760
releasing the progesterone now this will

1903
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:06,320
be responsible for the glandular nature

1904
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,719
of the endometrium so glandular nature

1905
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:12,199
of endometrium is because of the Corpus

1906
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:15,920
litium that is the

1907
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:18,560
progesterone

1908
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:21,560
okay tell me buddies clear

1909
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,920
right so two different process occur

1910
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,360
simultaneously hormones they are same

1911
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,080
okay so how you're going to write down

1912
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,320
in a paper you are going to write down

1913
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,840
first first you will explain what is a

1914
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,840
menual cycle menal cycle is a cyclic

1915
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,360
changes that occurs in ovaries and

1916
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,360
uterus in the ovaries there is

1917
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,840
development of follicle and the

1918
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,080
ovulation and in the uterus there is a

1919
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,920
formation and breakdown of endometrium

1920
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,639
everything is under the influence of

1921
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,599
hormone Mo I am explaining you

1922
01:39:53,599 --> 01:39:56,920
everything okay now what are the

1923
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,880
different step first step is a menual

1924
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,199
flow phase where are you going to

1925
01:40:02,199 --> 01:40:05,119
explain in this way menual flow phase

1926
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:07,159
second is proliferative Phase third one

1927
01:40:07,159 --> 01:40:09,360
is a secret secrety means secretive

1928
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,360
nature so that means the glandular

1929
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,639
nature of endometrium here it is

1930
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,239
folicular ovulation and the Lal this is

1931
01:40:17,239 --> 01:40:19,800
how if you learn everything you will not

1932
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,960
forget now tell me whether this topic is

1933
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,040
easy easiest or

1934
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,440
difficult I don't know by which way you

1935
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,520
have studied but this is super easy I'm

1936
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,760
telling you this is super super duper

1937
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,000
easy

1938
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,639
topic Lal is secretary phase yes the

1939
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,320
last phase Lal is secretary absolutely

1940
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,480
right both are I'm not see do not be

1941
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,400
confused some lual phase is a corpus

1942
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:51,599
lium formation that occur OV May and

1943
01:40:51,599 --> 01:40:53,920
here security they are parallel faces I

1944
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,360
won't say they were they're not

1945
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,880
interchangeable

1946
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,760
words they're not interchangeable words

1947
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,880
here these faces secretary face occur

1948
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,920
here here right they are the parel faces

1949
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:10,199
do not be confused okay tell

1950
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:14,040
me any doubt anyone everyone come on

1951
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,159
come on come

1952
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:19,840
on okay Lal phase duration Lal phase 15

1953
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,840
to 28 days

1954
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:26,080
okay CH let's start

1955
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,360
okay now let's talk about the next topic

1956
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:34,520
which is the which is the memory

1957
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,360
glands then yes the next cycle begins

1958
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,960
yes because Corpus luum has a life the

1959
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,719
progesterone level reduces estrogen

1960
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:45,119
level reduces when these two go now the

1961
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:46,639
endometrium will

1962
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:49,000
fall

1963
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,599
okay okie doie clear everyone CH come on

1964
01:41:53,599 --> 01:41:55,239
any doubt otherwise we have to start

1965
01:41:55,239 --> 01:41:59,440
with the next topic which is the menal

1966
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,960
cycle can we

1967
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:14,440
start huh okay so memory glands are what

1968
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,119
memory glands you all know these are the

1969
01:42:16,119 --> 01:42:19,239
paired structures develop in case of

1970
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:21,560
female glandular tissue

1971
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,159
and the size

1972
01:42:23,159 --> 01:42:27,080
varies as per the fat

1973
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,199
content okay now next is glandular

1974
01:42:30,199 --> 01:42:32,840
tissue of each breast is divided into 15

1975
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:36,920
to 20 memory

1976
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:41,880
lobes memory loes are there up everybody

1977
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:46,000
please Focus here otion can come in any

1978
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,199
form so you should know what are the

1979
01:42:48,199 --> 01:42:51,599
memory Loops so these are are I am

1980
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:55,280
drawing are the memory

1981
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Loops

1982
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,719
memory memory Lo clear is this point

1983
01:43:07,719 --> 01:43:11,000
clear now they contain cluster of cells

1984
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,480
this may you will find the cluster of

1985
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,520
cells are

1986
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,199
present look at this look at this

1987
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:23,480
aluli where there is milk

1988
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,639
formation what is this

1989
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:33,520
Alvi Alvi May what happens milk

1990
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,520
formation so there is a milk formation

1991
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:40,599
right this Alvi they open into the

1992
01:43:40,599 --> 01:43:43,400
memory

1993
01:43:44,119 --> 01:43:49,440
tubules memory tubules tubules Alvi

1994
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,320
memory tubules so alv these are not the

1995
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:54,639
lungs alali these are something else

1996
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:58,159
okay present in breast alali opening

1997
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:01,679
into memory tibul everything it is clear

1998
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,800
now now look at here different tubules

1999
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,719
they join and they form a

2000
01:44:07,719 --> 01:44:11,080
common memory

2001
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:18,280
duct what they form is the memory

2002
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:22,360
duct hope this point is clear

2003
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:25,920
right now this memory duct further lot

2004
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,360
of memory duct they open now let's come

2005
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:32,800
to thisp diagram okay guys can you see

2006
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,119
here

2007
01:44:34,119 --> 01:44:38,080
alviz can you see here alviz actually

2008
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,040
different memory loes are there and in

2009
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,040
memory loes I I'll I'll make this

2010
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,840
diagram better

2011
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:48,119
okay the lobes memory lobes memory lobes

2012
01:44:48,119 --> 01:44:51,360
May alval are there alali they open into

2013
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:54,880
duct you will see here duct ducts are

2014
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,440
there can you see duct now these ducts

2015
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:00,840
they are coming from each and every Alvi

2016
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,760
duct has a swollen swollen swollen area

2017
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,560
which is termed as ampula ampula ampula

2018
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,719
opens into a lactiferous duct ultimately

2019
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,639
the milk come out comes out through the

2020
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,080
N blackish portion brownish portion that

2021
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:22,119
is termed as arola so what is the flow

2022
01:45:22,119 --> 01:45:27,679
of uh milk so it is like

2023
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,800
alvioli Alvi right Alvi see yeah we have

2024
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:38,000
drawn the structure Alvi Alvi right

2025
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:43,880
Alvi then into memory

2026
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:47,360
tubules memory

2027
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:52,480
tibul memory tubules to memory

2028
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:58,599
duct duct now duct has a swollen portion

2029
01:45:58,599 --> 01:46:02,080
so it is like

2030
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:05,040
Alvi these are

2031
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,960
the

2032
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,639
tibes tibule one more tibule

2033
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:14,880
coming one more tibule

2034
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:18,080
coming they will form duct the these are

2035
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:22,320
the duct now this duct they swell

2036
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:26,920
up which is the ampula memory

2037
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,639
ampula ultimately opens into the

2038
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:33,639
lactiferous

2039
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:39,960
duct lactiferous do and then open to

2040
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,320
outside right this is the open to

2041
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:46,159
outside through the

2042
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:50,920
nipple development of breath breast is

2043
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:53,520
because of

2044
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:20,920
astrogenesis an

2045
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:24,040
because of this happens now the next

2046
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,360
thing

2047
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:32,760
is if I talk about the formation of

2048
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:38,400
milk formation of milk in the breast is

2049
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,520
because of

2050
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:48,520
prolactine now the next one next one is

2051
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:52,320
the ejection of milk

2052
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,480
ejection of milk so ejection of milk is

2053
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:00,760
because of

2054
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:04,520
oxytocin why milk is important milk is

2055
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,599
important for the overall development of

2056
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:11,679
a baby first milk is termed as

2057
01:48:15,599 --> 01:48:18,599
chrum

2058
01:48:19,239 --> 01:48:26,960
postr po now next is which is rich in IG

2059
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,840
antibod

2060
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,599
IG

2061
01:48:31,599 --> 01:48:35,119
IG it is

2062
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:40,920
colostrum right cestrum rich in

2063
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,560
IG done

2064
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,520
here okay now let's proceed see how

2065
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,080
beautifully we are completing our notes

2066
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,800
of also you will get these notes and it

2067
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,520
will be a great help for you buddies in

2068
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,520
your uh revision which you have to

2069
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:01,400
do now after some

2070
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:05,360
time okay yes okay now let's start the

2071
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,920
process of fertilization fertilization

2072
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,520
very important where does fertilization

2073
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,440
occur fertilization occur in the ampula

2074
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:15,840
region in the ampula there is uh sperm

2075
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,520
and the Egg they both of them they

2076
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,040
fertilize together okay

2077
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,920
okay

2078
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,920
first

2079
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,400
steps

2080
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,400
or

2081
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:38,080
fertilizer steps of

2082
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,800
fertilization first step of

2083
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,360
fertilization

2084
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,360
is

2085
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:50,400
insemination first there will be

2086
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,760
insemination right deposition of sperm

2087
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:53,960
into the female

2088
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:57,239
reproductive then

2089
01:49:57,239 --> 01:50:01,159
then see what happens is whenever the

2090
01:50:01,159 --> 01:50:04,000
sperms they are deposited into the

2091
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,760
female reproductive tract sperm has to

2092
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:10,360
move and the for the movement of sperm

2093
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,560
they undergo certain reaction that is

2094
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,320
termed as

2095
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,040
capacity

2096
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,800
capacity

2097
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,360
of

2098
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:27,560
sperms right this is important for the

2099
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,360
movement of

2100
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:32,239
SP I'll not explain this in DET that is

2101
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:35,599
it is not given in your of

2102
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,080
SP mement of

2103
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,480
sperms that sperms will move and how

2104
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:43,040
will the sperm see actually what happens

2105
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,320
is the the head of the sperm there will

2106
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,679
be some albumins attached those albines

2107
01:50:48,679 --> 01:50:50,960
they will be released which sperm they

2108
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,960
will be able to move towards the egg

2109
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,840
clear so that is important for the

2110
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,480
movement of sperm now the next step is

2111
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,960
the acrosomal

2112
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:06,560
reaction BM will reach to the egg there

2113
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,679
will be acrosomal reaction acrosomal

2114
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,000
reaction mean what happens

2115
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,840
is around the

2116
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:18,960
egg there will be some layers

2117
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,880
present no I'll

2118
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:26,679
explain

2119
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:32,960
okay some enzymes are released

2120
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:39,079
enzymes these enzymes are yalu

2121
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,800
Ron there will be

2122
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:47,679
Corona penetrating

2123
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:51,960
enzyme penetrating

2124
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:58,440
penetra and

2125
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:07,560
zonal zal H on days is the C now what

2126
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,040
happens in whenever eggs come over here

2127
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,119
first enzyme is hyaluron days you will

2128
01:52:12,119 --> 01:52:16,320
see here the follicular cells cells

2129
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,119
around the egg they are termed as

2130
01:52:18,119 --> 01:52:20,800
follicular cells what are these buddies

2131
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,000
can you see these are the follicular

2132
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,880
cells here now these follicular cells

2133
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:29,440
they will be attached by the hialuronic

2134
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,719
acid hyaluronic you remember you

2135
01:52:31,719 --> 01:52:33,520
attended the previous session talked

2136
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:38,000
about some you know outside the cell the

2137
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,400
intercellular spaces ground substances

2138
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,840
present which we call it as hialuronic

2139
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,639
acid so here also honic acid is present

2140
01:52:45,639 --> 01:52:47,560
so whenever sperm comes first thing is

2141
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,360
they release hyaluronidase which helps

2142
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,800
in the digestion of hyaluronic acid

2143
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,440
present around the follicular cells done

2144
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,159
so next layer you can see here that is a

2145
01:52:57,159 --> 01:53:00,199
cells of Corona radiator Corona radiat

2146
01:53:00,199 --> 01:53:02,400
cells are there Corona radiator cells

2147
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,159
will be digested by the corona

2148
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:07,960
penetrating enzyme done here third thing

2149
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:11,079
is Zona license internal to this there

2150
01:53:11,079 --> 01:53:15,040
is a Zona peluca layer Zona peluca layer

2151
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,280
Zona peluca layer will be digested by

2152
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:21,760
the Zona lysin now what will happen

2153
01:53:23,079 --> 01:53:27,000
happen yes now what will happen let's

2154
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,199
have a look acrosomal enzyme now what

2155
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:32,599
will happen see Next

2156
01:53:32,599 --> 01:53:36,639
Step prevention of

2157
01:53:37,639 --> 01:53:40,639
polyspermy

2158
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:46,719
first entry

2159
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,360
of

2160
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:51,760
sperm new

2161
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:57,800
nucleus and

2162
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:01,239
proximal

2163
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:06,599
Centrio in

2164
01:54:06,599 --> 01:54:09,119
egg see what happens is first

2165
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:10,800
insemination will occur then there will

2166
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,119
be capacit capacitation in the cervix

2167
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:15,159
region then there will be acrosomal

2168
01:54:15,159 --> 01:54:18,119
reaction every layer will be digested

2169
01:54:18,119 --> 01:54:19,440
then there will be entry of the sperm

2170
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,599
nule and the proximal cental proximal

2171
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:23,840
cental will be important for the first

2172
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,320
division of the egg now what will happen

2173
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:30,679
next is the prevention of

2174
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:36,079
polyspermy of polyspermy it will not

2175
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,280
allow further sperm to enter as one

2176
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,520
sperm is

2177
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:42,840
entered now this is termed as cortical

2178
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:46,920
reaction not given in detail cortical

2179
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,920
reaction cortical reaction clear now

2180
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,560
what will

2181
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:53,599
happen egg

2182
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:57,199
completes meosis

2183
01:54:58,119 --> 01:55:03,599
2 egg completes meosis

2184
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:06,560
2 completes meosis 2 how does egg

2185
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,880
complete meosis 2 because sperm comes

2186
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:13,880
with anas promoting factors and it will

2187
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,599
degenerate the metaphase promoting

2188
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:17,800
Factor now this is the one yes

2189
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:19,719
definitely cortical reaction or acros

2190
01:55:19,719 --> 01:55:21,440
reaction is different cortical reaction

2191
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:24,079
may I'll explain you what happens is in

2192
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:27,400
the perit line space can you see this

2193
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:30,760
not for the cbsc in fact because one

2194
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,320
student is asking that is a reason I'm

2195
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,480
explaining there will be cortical

2196
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,560
granules they will accumulate over here

2197
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,520
it's like a gate around the egg which

2198
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,639
will not allow further egg further

2199
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:44,280
sperms to enter if one sperm is entered

2200
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:46,360
there will be cortical reaction poly

2201
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:48,239
sperm because we don't want any other

2202
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:50,440
sperm to enter already one nucleus is

2203
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:52,880
entered one in fact nucleus and along

2204
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,320
with that the PC that is a proximal

2205
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:59,400
cental is also entered clear

2206
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,560
done

2207
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:04,079
okay

2208
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:08,840
okay H yes

2209
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:15,920
okay H let's proceed further now let's

2210
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,880
talk about this now what happens is this

2211
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:22,520
stage now there will be fertilization

2212
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,079
after the fertilization there will be

2213
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:27,040
formation of a zygote sorry this is a

2214
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:29,440
egg this is a

2215
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:32,360
egg this one indicates the

2216
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:36,119
fertilization this is a

2217
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:39,280
fertilization fertilization this is the

2218
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,400
C see here what happens is after the

2219
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,159
zygote there's a one cell State see if

2220
01:56:43,159 --> 01:56:45,360
you'll see here there's an egg release

2221
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,639
over here fertilization fertilization

2222
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:49,800
occurs here which region is this this is

2223
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,599
a ampula

2224
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:53,320
region

2225
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:55,880
ampula okay now there will be two cell

2226
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:57,920
stage and they are migrating as well as

2227
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:59,119
they are developing there will be two

2228
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:00,840
cell stage there will be four cell stage

2229
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:03,560
there will be 8 to 16 cell stage there

2230
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:08,159
will be 8 to 16 cell stage now 8 to 16

2231
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:10,280
cell stage is termed as

2232
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:13,280
morula this is termed as morula solid

2233
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,400
mass of boss of ball of cell that is a

2234
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:18,360
morula malur like now this will further

2235
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:21,320
develop into this structure which will

2236
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,440
further develop into this structure

2237
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,760
which is termed as blastocyst so what is

2238
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,079
a blastocyst blastocyst has an outermost

2239
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:31,079
layer which is termed as

2240
01:57:31,079 --> 01:57:36,239
trophoblast trophoblast or tropo

2241
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,159
aoom troa

2242
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:43,000
Toom which along with the uterine wve it

2243
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,119
will form the placenta and it is having

2244
01:57:46,119 --> 01:57:48,400
the ICM Inner Cell

2245
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:51,239
Mass

2246
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:53,560
Inner Cell Mass so Inner Cell mass will

2247
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:56,639
form the baby whole baby formation will

2248
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:59,280
be because of the ICM trophoblast of the

2249
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:04,119
tropho acto will form the

2250
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:10,520
this clear yes so here there will be C

2251
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:13,560
development like this okay so here we

2252
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,400
call this as a cleavage we don't call

2253
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:17,480
this as mitosis the reason we call do

2254
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,719
not call this as mitosis because here if

2255
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:21,560
you'll see the SI size of the zygote and

2256
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,400
size of a two cells eight cell stage the

2257
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:26,000
size is same only the cell divides right

2258
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,880
cell do not increase in

2259
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:32,400
size okay buddies now trophoblast again

2260
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,360
I'm saying a with the uterine wall they

2261
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,880
form the

2262
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,840
placenta so so this is how the baby look

2263
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,040
like so tropho blast or the tropo ooom

2264
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,320
they form the placenta along with the

2265
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:50,040
uterus wall uterus wall so they form the

2266
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,159
placental V placental V and the uterine

2267
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:55,000
uh tissues they are like this they are

2268
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
closely attached to each other this is

2269
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,360
the structure which is attached to the

2270
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,520
baby which is termed as a umblical cord

2271
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,719
this is a baby or the embryo developed

2272
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,599
there is a yok saac which is not that

2273
01:59:04,599 --> 01:59:06,320
developed not required this is a cavity

2274
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,880
of the uterus this is a plug of mucus

2275
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:12,199
mucus plug is attached here and the baby

2276
01:59:12,199 --> 01:59:17,040
is there in the amniotic fluid okay

2277
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,800
amniotic fluid

2278
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,719
so now guys let's move on to the

2279
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,400
development in human being after 1 month

2280
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:27,560
of pregnancy first structure which is

2281
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:30,480
formed is dgd that is the heart you know

2282
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,800
whenever a female expecting female if

2283
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,960
she is a 1 month one month 15 days

2284
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,960
pregnant she goes to a doctor doctor

2285
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,920
first check the pregnancy with the help

2286
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,920
of a HCG either by a blood or the urine

2287
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,520
test if HCG that is a human cionic

2288
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,599
gonadotropin only secreted at the time

2289
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,320
of pregnancy is there in the mother's

2290
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:51,760
blood or the mother's urine that means

2291
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:54,280
it she is positive for the she's having

2292
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,639
a positive pregnancy now that is one

2293
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:59,079
test now the second test is ultrasound

2294
01:59:59,079 --> 02:00:01,639
which female should go through to know

2295
02:00:01,639 --> 02:00:03,440
whether the implantation is at the

2296
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,360
proper position or not so the first test

2297
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:08,079
that another test that is I told you

2298
02:00:08,079 --> 02:00:11,440
that is a ultrasound it gives it in that

2299
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:14,119
case Doctor listen to the heart sound

2300
02:00:14,119 --> 02:00:16,760
also so first structure which is formed

2301
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:20,400
is the heart that is even at the end of

2302
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,880
one month when a fe one month baby one

2303
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,679
month baby when she got to know her

2304
02:00:24,679 --> 02:00:26,320
first menal cycle is not there because

2305
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,400
after 28 days only she will get to know

2306
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,280
whether she is pregnant or not in case

2307
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:33,440
she missed the menal cycle so that means

2308
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,280
chances that she can be a she can be

2309
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,560
pregnant so that is the reason she goes

2310
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,880
to a doctor the first sign of growing

2311
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,880
fetus may be noticed by listening to the

2312
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:42,960
heart sound carefully through the

2313
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:45,119
stethoscope with the help of stethoscope

2314
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:46,880
also with the help of a ultrasound

2315
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,239
machine also they can be

2316
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:51,760
H

2317
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,360
okay by the end of the second month

2318
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:57,159
pregnancy fetus develops Limbs and the

2319
02:00:57,159 --> 02:00:59,719
digits all these the data whatever I'm

2320
02:00:59,719 --> 02:01:02,239
discussing is there in your ncrt so

2321
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:04,800
please focus at the end of 12 weeks that

2322
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,920
is a first trimester three trimesters

2323
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:09,320
are there first trimester I am seeing

2324
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:11,920
most of the organ formation occur for

2325
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,079
example limbs external organs are welld

2326
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:17,840
developed first movement fifth month at

2327
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,800
the end of the first movement at the end

2328
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,840
of fifth month movement appearance of

2329
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:24,760
here on the head is usually seen so

2330
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:27,199
movement fifth month if I talk about the

2331
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:29,280
heart sound heart sound at the end of

2332
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,560
first month

2333
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:35,360
now by the end of 24th week at the end

2334
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,360
of second trimester body is covered with

2335
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,320
a fine here eyelid separate eyelashes

2336
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,480
formation occur at the end of the N9

2337
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,360
month of pregnancy the fetus is fully

2338
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:48,040
developed and it is ready for the

2339
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:52,560
delivery okay progesterone is an

2340
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,880
hormone progesterone is in hormone

2341
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:58,440
female May what's the

2342
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:00,280
issue

2343
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:02,920
okay okay now let's talk about the

2344
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:07,520
partur so signal for

2345
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:10,800
partur

2346
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,800
for

2347
02:02:16,119 --> 02:02:21,760
partur comes from fully

2348
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:26,000
developed fully

2349
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,960
developed

2350
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,280
fetus plus

2351
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,960
placenta

2352
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:37,440
okay now at the 40th week near the 40th

2353
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,920
week the baby you know the baby has a

2354
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,440
less space and baby is developing so

2355
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:45,239
they will create a signal along with the

2356
02:02:45,239 --> 02:02:49,760
placenta due to which it lead to mild

2357
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,800
uterine

2358
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:55,760
contraction female will feel mild

2359
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:57,800
uterine contraction because of some

2360
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:59,480
prostag

2361
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,800
glanding

2362
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:07,280
contractions signal will go to the

2363
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:10,599
hypothalamus hypothalamus with the help

2364
02:03:10,599 --> 02:03:12,679
of posterior

2365
02:03:12,679 --> 02:03:15,239
pitutary posterior

2366
02:03:15,239 --> 02:03:18,280
pitutary will release a hormone which is

2367
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:20,880
oxy

2368
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,599
oxytocin which is the one which is

2369
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:28,119
responsible for strong uterine

2370
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:32,960
contraction uterine

2371
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:36,079
contraction then more and more uterine

2372
02:03:36,079 --> 02:03:38,199
contraction will occur see here what

2373
02:03:38,199 --> 02:03:41,440
happens is positive reflex if a baby is

2374
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,520
there and baby is trying to push a baby

2375
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:47,079
is producing some mild contraction

2376
02:03:47,079 --> 02:03:49,079
oxytocin will come and oxytocin will

2377
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:51,920
cause stronger contraction of the uterus

2378
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:55,040
right initially the uterus May though

2379
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,000
these uh you know the contraction

2380
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,199
duration will be more with time the

2381
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:02,000
contraction duration becomes less right

2382
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,000
and because of the strong uterine

2383
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:11,320
contraction baby birth occurs that is a

2384
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:13,800
pation that is

2385
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:19,360
the partur pation will occur right baby

2386
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,960
will be

2387
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:25,079
born zygote is deployed then male and

2388
02:04:25,079 --> 02:04:29,800
female gamuts are hloy some of they

2389
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:33,000
heid they're

2390
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,679
heid okay now let's talk about lactation

2391
02:04:36,679 --> 02:04:39,679
lactation

2392
02:04:42,599 --> 02:04:45,599
lactation

2393
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,760
lactation

2394
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:56,079
lactation as I've

2395
02:04:56,079 --> 02:05:00,079
discussed formation of

2396
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:06,000
milk formation of milk is because

2397
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,239
of the

2398
02:05:09,239 --> 02:05:12,280
prolactin prolactin where does prolactin

2399
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:14,800
comes prolactins comes from anterior

2400
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:20,679
pitutary it comes from anterior pitutary

2401
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:22,719
where does it come it comes from

2402
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:26,000
anterior pitu clear so because of this

2403
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,800
there will be formation of milk now as

2404
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,079
the baby suckles so at the time of

2405
02:05:31,079 --> 02:05:35,679
delivery let's say at the time of

2406
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:39,920
delivery there will be

2407
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:43,119
oxytocin oxytocin come and oxytocin

2408
02:05:43,119 --> 02:05:44,679
because of oxytocin there will be

2409
02:05:44,679 --> 02:05:47,199
ejection of

2410
02:05:47,199 --> 02:05:49,239
milk ejection

2411
02:05:49,239 --> 02:05:54,079
of milk now more a baby suckles more a

2412
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:56,719
baby suck it goes to a signal goes to a

2413
02:05:56,719 --> 02:05:58,920
brain there will be more formation of

2414
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:01,840
milk just after a baby is

2415
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:05,079
born in many cases female doesn't get

2416
02:06:05,079 --> 02:06:08,159
the milk in that case she's always

2417
02:06:08,159 --> 02:06:11,000
recommended by doctors that she should

2418
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,320
uh let she should let the child suckle

2419
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:16,679
more a baby sucks the milk try to suck

2420
02:06:16,679 --> 02:06:19,559
the milk more the you know the

2421
02:06:19,559 --> 02:06:21,960
hypothalamus uh sorry the anterior pit

2422
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:24,800
they start releasing the

2423
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:28,320
prolactin right

2424
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:32,719
clear okay buies clear

2425
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:35,559
yes yes anterior pitutary this prolactin

2426
02:06:35,559 --> 02:06:37,040
comes from anterior

2427
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:40,040
pitutary

2428
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,230
okay one

2429

2449
02:07:47,079 --> 02:07:49,480
students they said ke n n we'll not do

2450
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:52,360
questions here because it's not uh it's

2451
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:55,679
not s it's not s here because it will be

2452
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:57,840
a theory paper everything I have

2453
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,719
discussed the detail Theory and

2454
02:07:59,719 --> 02:08:02,119
everything but uh it will not be easy

2455
02:08:02,119 --> 02:08:06,480
for me to discuss question also

2456
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:09,000
okay

2457
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,520
okay

2458
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:14,360
okay some let's

2459
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:18,920
start reproductive Health reproductive

2460
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,920
Health

2461
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:23,679
okay so what do we mean by reproductive

2462
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:25,760
Health reproductive Health like overall

2463
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:29,400
health means we should be fit not only

2464
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,000
uh you know physically there is an

2465
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,920
absence of disease but we should say ke

2466
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:35,920
we should be mentally fit we should be

2467
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:39,000
socially fit that is important similarly

2468
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,639
wh gave the definition that reproductive

2469
02:08:41,639 --> 02:08:44,000
Health means one should be fit the

2470
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,559
reproductive organ should work properly

2471
02:08:46,559 --> 02:08:48,480
in fact there should not be any kind of

2472
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:51,239
of social any kind of mental pressure

2473
02:08:51,239 --> 02:08:55,199
should be there right so you all know

2474
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:57,679
there was a time when maternal mortality

2475
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:00,079
rate was really very high there was a

2476
02:09:00,079 --> 02:09:02,280
time when infant mortality rate was very

2477
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:04,480
high can you tell me the

2478
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:08,040
reason can you tell me the reason why

2479
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:10,880
why because of the poor development

2480
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,280
because of the because earlier the

2481
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:17,360
female used to give birth at home only

2482
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:19,119
untrained profession

2483
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:20,679
like people were there who used to take

2484
02:09:20,679 --> 02:09:23,599
care of mother and when a child is born

2485
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:26,440
that is a new life for a female also in

2486
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:29,000
the term key the female will definitely

2487
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,440
undergo lot of changes in her body

2488
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:34,040
she'll be facing lot of blood uh loss

2489
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:36,119
from the body yes there was a lack of

2490
02:09:36,119 --> 02:09:38,400
awareness very nice just me so that was

2491
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:44,559
one of the reason now reproductive

2492
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:49,400
Health right so with time with time we

2493
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:52,480
developed so many things I would like to

2494
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:55,239
discuss one

2495
02:09:56,559 --> 02:09:59,079
thing so let's start from the beginning

2496
02:09:59,079 --> 02:10:01,320
leave

2497
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,800
it

2498
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:09,239
reproductive

2499
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:15,920
Health reproductive health so according

2500
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:19,559
to wh that is a world Health

2501
02:10:19,559 --> 02:10:22,239
Organization reproductive Health

2502
02:10:22,239 --> 02:10:27,480
means needs to be fit the person needs

2503
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:30,559
to be

2504
02:10:30,559 --> 02:10:33,559
fit

2505
02:10:35,079 --> 02:10:37,760
physically

2506
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:40,760
physically

2507
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:45,960
socially what else what do you think the

2508
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:49,280
person should be fit by what way

2509
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:52,280
right

2510
02:10:54,559 --> 02:10:57,639
mentally right this is what the def

2511
02:10:57,639 --> 02:11:01,599
definition of wh was clear so in that

2512
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:04,679
respect because of the poor you know

2513
02:11:04,679 --> 02:11:07,480
awareness there was no awareness there

2514
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:10,760
was awareness was very

2515
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:14,520
less was very less so government of

2516
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:18,199
India was first country who started rep

2517
02:11:18,199 --> 02:11:20,800
reproductive and Child Health Care

2518
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,679
Program when was it started come on let

2519
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:25,679
me know in the comment section

2520
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:29,719
reproductive and

2521
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:33,800
Child healthc

2522
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:36,400

02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:39,800
Program started reproductive and Child

2524
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:42,320
Health Care

2525
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:47,159
Program come on tell me

2526
02:11:47,159 --> 02:11:53,079
yes when was it started come on tell me

2527
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:59,520
1951 1951 it was started okay yes prabas

2528
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:02,480
absolutely right good so in the 1951 we

2529
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:05,119
started that is just to create awareness

2530
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:07,480
and how was awareness created awareness

2531
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:09,800
was created with the use of the print

2532
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:12,760
media with the help of a social media uh

2533
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:15,400
with the help of radio Etc awareness was

2534
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:18,320
created people were told about the STD

2535
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:20,280
people were told about the contraceptive

2536
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:22,639
pills people were told about the hygiene

2537
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:24,320
how they can maintain hygiene of a

2538
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:27,559
private part people were uh told

2539
02:12:27,559 --> 02:12:31,760
regarding the uh you know the the child

2540
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:34,159
care when a baby is born how to take

2541
02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:36,360
care of that kid when a mother uh

2542
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:38,040
delivers a baby how to take care of that

2543
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:41,599
mother that's it so with time what we

2544
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:44,679
faced was the population explosion that

2545
02:12:44,679 --> 02:12:46,520
was one of the reason because of the

2546
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:50,639
huge population here not only um in the

2547
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:53,320
world in fact in India also you know the

2548
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:54,920
you know there's a biggest problem today

2549
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:57,559
we have is a good

2550
02:12:57,559 --> 02:13:00,199
population many time we feel that as

2551
02:13:00,199 --> 02:13:01,520
compared to other

2552
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:04,199
countries this comes in everyone mind ke

2553
02:13:04,199 --> 02:13:07,320
why we are not that U you know we don't

2554
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:08,719
have those things which are there in

2555
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:10,840
other countries the one of the reason is

2556
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:14,599
population it's really very difficult to

2557
02:13:14,599 --> 02:13:19,079
manage this much population here

2558
02:13:19,079 --> 02:13:22,040
we see when we have a small population

2559
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:23,800
it's easy to manage but when we have a

2560
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:25,400
huge population it's very difficult to

2561
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,360
manage so one of the reason was the

2562
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:29,960
population explosion the world

2563
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:31,520
population which was around 2 billion

2564
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,599
this is just a data given in ncrt so

2565
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:35,880
that data I'm reading here 2 billion

2566
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:39,800
1900 May rocketed to 6 billion by 2000 a

2567
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:42,199
similar Trend was observed in India to

2568
02:13:42,199 --> 02:13:44,159
our population which was approximately

2569
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:45,800
350 million at the time of our

2570
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:48,000
independence were close to 1 billion

2571
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,520
Mark by 2000 and cross 1 billion in May

2572
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:53,079
to 2,000 that means every sixth person

2573
02:13:53,079 --> 02:13:55,320
in the world is Indian right it is

2574
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:57,480
actually a big issue but if you'll

2575
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:59,880
thinking n why we are why do if you go

2576
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:01,320
to any foreign country I recently

2577
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:03,480
visited one uh

2578
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:05,520
country everything was so fine

2579
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,280
everything was so uh uh you know

2580
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:10,800
organized it's not because the

2581
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,199
population is less and actually I

2582
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:16,159
realized here it's we always blame our

2583
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:18,119
government that government is not doing

2584
02:14:18,119 --> 02:14:20,880
this government is not doing that but

2585
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,440
seriously buddies one should really

2586
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:26,520
think about it to manage this much

2587
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,440
population it's very a difficult uh

2588
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:35,520
thing H yes so literacy rate is also uh

2589
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,440
not that

2590
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:41,199
good okay let's start so reason for

2591
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:43,760
population exp population explosion the

2592
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:45,559
rapid decline in the death rate with

2593
02:14:45,559 --> 02:14:47,559
time you know hospitals came and the

2594
02:14:47,559 --> 02:14:49,840
Serv Services also came and there was a

2595
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,760
decline in the birth rate uh sorry the

2596
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,760
death rate maternal mortality rate also

2597
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,639
reduced and the infant mortality reduce

2598
02:14:56,639 --> 02:14:59,760
was all was also reduced contribution of

2599
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:01,320
reproductive and child health program

2600
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:03,520
was marginal effects of population

2601
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:05,679
explosion poverty unemployment energy

2602
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:07,280
crisis overcrowding in cities and

2603
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,159
increasing in the crime rate these are

2604
02:15:09,159 --> 02:15:11,199
some very uh basic thing the

2605
02:15:11,199 --> 02:15:12,679
reproductive and Child Health Care

2606
02:15:12,679 --> 02:15:15,079
Program here came up with an idea that

2607
02:15:15,079 --> 02:15:17,159
we should aware people regarding this

2608
02:15:17,159 --> 02:15:18,559
hamar

2609
02:15:18,559 --> 02:15:20,679
they promote small families here in

2610
02:15:20,679 --> 02:15:22,280
India if you have a small families

2611
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:25,119
government always promote those in fact

2612
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:28,199
uh there are uh many school here who

2613
02:15:28,199 --> 02:15:30,520
give preference to those families those

2614
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,960
kid here in um I'll tell you I'm from

2615
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:37,239
Delhi and recently I was uh reading of a

2616
02:15:37,239 --> 02:15:39,480
newspaper where the couple they are

2617
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:42,719
struggling to get their child admission

2618
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:44,639
in the nursery itself is a big deal here

2619
02:15:44,639 --> 02:15:46,719
I don't know about your state it's a big

2620
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:50,239
deal here the one of the reason

2621
02:15:50,239 --> 02:15:53,199
is uh number of you know the population

2622
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:55,920
is really very high another thing is

2623
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,360
here in India uh here in Delhi I don't

2624
02:15:58,360 --> 02:15:59,639
know about the other

2625
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:03,520
state U if you have a single child so

2626
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:05,119
and that to a girl

2627
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:07,599
child in fact the schools they give

2628
02:16:07,599 --> 02:16:10,320
priority they give some points it's

2629
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:13,880
there right so governments takes lot of

2630
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:16,800
step to control the population One Step

2631
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,520
which they started was

2632
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,480
right second thing is one child Norm so

2633
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:23,719
they always promote a one child Norm

2634
02:16:23,719 --> 02:16:25,520
statutory raising of the marriageable

2635
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:28,320
age of a female to 18 years and the male

2636
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:31,639
to 21 years though still in many state

2637
02:16:31,639 --> 02:16:34,240
early marriages are there incentive

2638
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,718
given to couple having the small

2639
02:16:35,718 --> 02:16:38,478
families even in India those who are

2640
02:16:38,478 --> 02:16:39,679
having a small families and they are

2641
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:42,280
having a girl child government provide

2642
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:46,080
some fund right U there is one yena I'm

2643
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:49,200
aware of it suya Sami yena so where you

2644
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,040
have to deposit some amount in your

2645
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,359
child account of girl child account and

2646
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:55,558
government also provide that similarly

2647
02:16:55,558 --> 02:16:57,799
there is another yogena by which uh

2648
02:16:57,799 --> 02:17:01,000
government provide books uh you know the

2649
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,160
all the expenses related to education to

2650
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:05,040
a girl child so so many things

2651
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:06,439
government has started they're working

2652
02:17:06,439 --> 02:17:08,000
definitely in this direction because

2653
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,879
ultimately the first thing is we have to

2654
02:17:09,879 --> 02:17:11,920
control the population with this

2655
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:14,398
population definitely we cannot grow we

2656
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:19,598
cannot we cannot see development

2657
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,879
now another uh awareness which was

2658
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:25,879
created in our country was related to

2659
02:17:25,879 --> 02:17:27,599
the contraceptive people were not aware

2660
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:30,959
of the contraceptive so contraceptive

2661
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:32,558
particular part is there in your cabus

2662
02:17:32,558 --> 02:17:33,959
and that to in detail because you being

2663
02:17:33,959 --> 02:17:35,599
biology student so you should know about

2664
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:38,359
it okay so these are the contraceptives

2665
02:17:38,359 --> 02:17:39,799
so what are these contraceptive

2666
02:17:39,799 --> 02:17:43,558
contraceptives are the birth control

2667
02:17:43,558 --> 02:17:49,598
methods birth control methods

2668
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:53,080
do you know which is the prevalent which

2669
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:56,080
is the most mostly people U which

2670
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:59,200
contraceptive method people use a lot

2671
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,679
here in

2672
02:18:00,679 --> 02:18:03,879
India can you tell me what's that that's

2673
02:18:03,879 --> 02:18:07,359
a copper tea that's a copper tea yes

2674
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:08,920
that's a intrauterine devices not the

2675
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:11,638
barrier method no not the that is the

2676
02:18:11,638 --> 02:18:14,280
intrauterine devices here in India but

2677
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:17,398
if I talk because here people men's they

2678
02:18:17,398 --> 02:18:19,000
have this mentality that they do not

2679
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,240
want to use any

2680
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:23,040
barrier yes but in outside if I talk

2681
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,760
about the outside India they use uh you

2682
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:28,000
know the barrier method such as condoms

2683
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,240
Etc so what are these what are these

2684
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:33,000
contraceptive devices contraceptives are

2685
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,599
the birth control methods there are

2686
02:18:34,599 --> 02:18:36,318
various birth control methods uh

2687
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:37,599
available in the market that I'll be

2688
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:39,920
discussing in detail now regulation of

2689
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,799
contraception by preventive methods or

2690
02:18:41,799 --> 02:18:43,638
devices to limit the number of Offspring

2691
02:18:43,638 --> 02:18:46,318
is termed as a birth

2692
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:48,638
control now

2693
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:50,478
what are the different characteristic of

2694
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:53,840
a ideal contraceptive it should be user

2695
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:56,240
friendly easily available nor or least

2696
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:58,359
side effect no way to interfere with the

2697
02:18:58,359 --> 02:19:01,799
sexual drive okay so now let's talk

2698
02:19:01,799 --> 02:19:04,799
about the methods of contraception so

2699
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:08,678
first let's talk about the natural

2700
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:13,439
method natural method of

2701
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:15,799
contraception so in natural method of

2702
02:19:15,799 --> 02:19:21,239
contraception we have a is lactational

2703
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:26,080
amoria

2704
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:31,359
lactational

2705
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:35,120
amoria lactational amoria means when a

2706
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:36,478
female is

2707
02:19:36,478 --> 02:19:41,478
lecta Right female is

2708
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:46,319
lecta when a female

2709
02:19:46,439 --> 02:19:48,599
lactating

2710
02:19:48,599 --> 02:19:52,479
then there is no menstrual cycle when

2711
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:54,600
there is no menstrual cycle so there

2712
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:56,880
will be no

2713
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:59,520
ovulation no ovulation that means in

2714
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:02,560
this particular time if if if

2715
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:05,040
insemination occur then there will be no

2716
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:08,240
pregnancy though this particular method

2717
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:11,000
is you know it's not the case it only

2718
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,840
occur in it is only possible when a

2719
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:15,080
female is highly lactating because when

2720
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:17,640
prolactin level is high that particular

2721
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:20,560
time no menal cycle no menal flow occur

2722
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:22,960
because it suppress the gonard dropin

2723
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:26,840
FSH and LH right no menal cycle why

2724
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:30,040
because of increase in the prolactine

2725
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:32,520
hormone and due to which there is

2726
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:36,600
decrease in the FSH and

2727
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:40,200
LH so in this particular time period

2728
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:42,240
there is no meal cycle this is

2729
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:43,439
lactational

2730
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:48,920
amoria now moving on to the next

2731
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:51,720
periodic

2732
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:02,920
abstinence periodic abstinence you all

2733
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:06,000
know ovulation occur

2734
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,880
at ovulation occur at when does

2735
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:12,160
ovulation occur ovulation occur at day

2736
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:18,680
14 right clear now egg has a life of

2737
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:23,439
egg has a life of around

2738
02:21:23,479 --> 02:21:30,800
24 24 hours right so it means no

2739
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:33,760
quas quitus means

2740
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:36,720
intercourse

2741
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,399
from

2742
02:21:38,399 --> 02:21:41,920
day 11 to

2743
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:44,960
17 If egg is there in female body so

2744
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,920
that means there will be pregnancy if if

2745
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:50,080
no insemination at that time when there

2746
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:53,439
is egg in the body so there will not be

2747
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:56,319
any pregnancy periodic abstinence

2748
02:21:56,319 --> 02:21:58,840
periodic periodic it's also termed as

2749
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:02,680
calendar method this is also termed

2750
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:06,399
as calendar

2751
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:09,200
method by looking at the calendar yes

2752
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:12,080
earlier people used to track their uh

2753
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:15,800
menal cycle by this way now the third

2754
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:19,160
one is quite a

2755
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:25,880
interruptus quas

2756
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:30,600
interruptus qu us interrupt us that

2757
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:34,439
means do

2758
02:22:34,439 --> 02:22:37,439
not

2759
02:22:38,359 --> 02:22:41,359
deposit

2760
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:46,560
FBS in female reproductive tract so that

2761
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:50,439
means during quitus female abstain the

2762
02:22:50,439 --> 02:22:52,920
male abstain him abstain himself and do

2763
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,600
not deposit the sperm in the female

2764
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:58,560
reproductive track in fact the deposit

2765
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:01,880
outside

2766
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:06,800
okay okay guys clear yes good job after

2767
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:10,800
day 16 17 this is a tentative time now

2768
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:12,720
out of this method if I talk about the

2769
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,800
natural method so natural method C there

2770
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:19,200
is no side effect because nothing we are

2771
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:23,279
using from outside no side effect but

2772
02:23:23,279 --> 02:23:26,279
this is not very

2773
02:23:26,279 --> 02:23:29,720
effective not very effective so one one

2774
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,319
people are doing is people they just

2775
02:23:31,319 --> 02:23:34,160
study their own body isn't it what do

2776
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:35,399
are the people doing they are just

2777
02:23:35,399 --> 02:23:37,640
studying their own body isn't it are

2778
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:39,640
they using anything from outside no

2779
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:42,960
right so this is a natural

2780
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:46,359
method or this is also termed as that is

2781
02:23:46,359 --> 02:23:49,800
the TR traditional method right now

2782
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:53,600
moving on to the next is barrier

2783
02:23:57,319 --> 02:23:59,680
method these are something which use

2784
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:03,560
from outside barrier

2785
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:07,000
method barrier method barrier that means

2786
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,160
some barrier is there that means we have

2787
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:11,479
a

2788
02:24:11,479 --> 02:24:14,359
barrier and because of this barrier the

2789
02:24:14,359 --> 02:24:16,000
female

2790
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,680
gamut

2791
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:22,080
is not able to meet the male

2792
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:25,640
gamet that barrier we have created

2793
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:31,279
clear okay now here let's talk about the

2794
02:24:31,279 --> 02:24:33,800
different barrier method first let's

2795
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:37,319
talk about for the male for the male we

2796
02:24:37,319 --> 02:24:40,840
have just one that is

2797
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:45,560
condom which is made up of latex or

2798
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,600
rubber right

2799
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:50,240
which is disposable and this prevent the

2800
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:54,479
STD also right and now this one next one

2801
02:24:54,479 --> 02:24:56,840
for the

2802
02:24:56,840 --> 02:25:01,920
female for the female we have is

2803
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:06,319
following we have is

2804
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:12,520
diaphragm we have is

2805
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:18,880
walls and we have a cervical caps

2806
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:23,319
right these are the one which female

2807
02:25:23,319 --> 02:25:28,319
uses they are condom it's like this they

2808
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:29,680
have a

2809
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:33,080
cap something like this and this is how

2810
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:35,479
a diaphragm look like which female use

2811
02:25:35,479 --> 02:25:38,479
on the cervix uh so that the sperm

2812
02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:41,399
should not enter yes this protuct from

2813
02:25:41,399 --> 02:25:43,920
the STD so these are the barrier method

2814
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:48,040
the condom diaphragm and the w s right

2815
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:51,240
cervical caps they see they resembles

2816
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:53,840
diaphragm only and they are smaller and

2817
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:55,800
more

2818
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:59,080
rigid and this uh one should prescribe

2819
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,040
this by the doctor because it depends

2820
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:04,920
upon the female Sur size the cervix size

2821
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:07,800
because one has to place over the cervix

2822
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,520
sometime this is also used with the

2823
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:11,359
spermicidal Creeps in the jelly so

2824
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:12,920
whenever sperm will come in come in

2825
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:15,479
contact with it the sperms they will die

2826
02:26:15,479 --> 02:26:17,279
yes they are disposable they canot be

2827
02:26:17,279 --> 02:26:19,880
they cannot be reused

2828
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:23,920
again right but out of this if I say uh

2829
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:26,319
the vaults are the one which can be used

2830
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:27,840
again so these are

2831
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:31,439
reusable these are the

2832
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:34,680
reusable they can be reused again female

2833
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:36,640
she can use this again after washing she

2834
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:40,000
can easily use this

2835
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:42,200
again

2836
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:45,399
okay okay similarly in the female also

2837
02:26:45,399 --> 02:26:47,840
female case may see in the female case

2838
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:49,920
also the female condoms are

2839
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:52,439
available female condoms are also there

2840
02:26:52,439 --> 02:26:54,359
and female condoms are available by the

2841
02:26:54,359 --> 02:26:56,399
trade name of

2842
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:59,399
fidom

2843
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:03,600
fidom done now let's move on to the next

2844
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:05,439
one that is

2845
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:09,359
the intrauterine

2846
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:18,720
devices intra uterine

2847
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:23,760
devices intrauterine devices

2848
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:26,479
iuds so name itself indicate these are

2849
02:27:26,479 --> 02:27:29,600
the iods which one person has to use in

2850
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,760
their uterus so what is that one person

2851
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:34,319
that definitely that's a female so that

2852
02:27:34,319 --> 02:27:37,640
is used by

2853
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:43,800
female used by female and she plac it it

2854
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:46,240
in the uterus so there are three type of

2855
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:51,080
intra uterine devices first one is

2856
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:56,479
non-medicated nonmedicated

2857
02:27:56,479 --> 02:27:58,960
iuds come on write down in comment

2858
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:00,600
section the different type of

2859
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:02,160
non-medicated

2860
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:05,080
iuds yes and what are their function

2861
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:07,040
that also I'll let you know second one

2862
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:10,319
is a copper releasing

2863
02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:15,640
IUD copper releasing

2864
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:18,439
iuds

2865
02:28:18,439 --> 02:28:23,040
and third one is a hormone releasing

2866
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:29,880
IUD hormone releasing

2867
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:33,920
iuds non-medicated

2868
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,680
iuds

2869
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:39,760
yes yes yes yes so come on write down so

2870
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:41,680
these are the non-medicated one is a

2871
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:44,160
lippes loop very nice

2872
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:48,560
buddies lippes Loop good job copper

2873
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:50,560
releasing is the copper

2874
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:53,080
T copper

2875
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:56,920
7 multiload

2876
02:28:57,319 --> 02:29:00,160
375 multiload

2877
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:03,000
375 the next one is a hormone releasing

2878
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,800
is

2879
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:06,439
LNG

2880
02:29:06,439 --> 02:29:09,720
20 and

2881
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:18,279
prester okay

2882
02:29:18,279 --> 02:29:21,760
come on is this point

2883
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:34,279
clear right now let's talk about their

2884
02:29:34,279 --> 02:29:37,960
function first first is written here

2885
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:41,640
lippes Loop

2886
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:44,640
sperm

2887
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:48,720
phagocytosis whenever sperm will come in

2888
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:51,800
contact with it sperm will die because

2889
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:52,680
of

2890
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:55,960
this sperm FOC yosis this will cause

2891
02:29:55,960 --> 02:29:58,359
sperm

2892
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:03,080
phagocytosis

2893
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:06,040
phagocytosis and decrease fertilizing

2894
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:09,359
capacity of

2895
02:30:09,359 --> 02:30:15,439
SPM decrease fertilizing capacity of

2896
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:18,439
sperm

2897
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:22,240
of sperms now the next One progesta S

2898
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:25,880
and this this um this this will release

2899
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:27,560
definitely some hormone and because they

2900
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:31,399
release a hormone so they

2901
02:30:31,399 --> 02:30:35,520
make uh

2902
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:39,920
cervix in hostile for

2903
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:42,000
sperm

2904
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,680
for

2905
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:48,439
sperm and

2906
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:52,880
unsuitable for

2907
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:58,560
implantation for

2908
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:03,840
implantation unsuitable for

2909
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:09,040
implantation right

2910
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:13,319
yes okay everyone

2911
02:31:13,319 --> 02:31:15,359
D come

2912
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:18,880
on so now moving on to the next let's

2913
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:22,399
talk about the oral

2914
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:35,200
contraceptive

2915
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,200
oral

2916
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:42,600
contraceptives oral contraceptives so

2917
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:44,800
oral contraceptives they are of further

2918
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:47,359
type so contra contraceptives let's say

2919
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:48,800
contraceptive then I'll be talking about

2920
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:50,840
the oral contraceptive and injectables

2921
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:53,560
so oral contraceptive may we are having

2922
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:57,000
is the

2923
02:31:57,120 --> 02:32:01,040
pills right we have is the pills pills

2924
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:03,080
are the basically they're made up of the

2925
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:04,479
progesterone and

2926
02:32:04,479 --> 02:32:07,479
estrogen so progest synthetic

2927
02:32:07,479 --> 02:32:10,359
progesterone and estrogen due to which

2928
02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:12,279
it will not allow

2929
02:32:12,279 --> 02:32:15,279
ovulation no

2930
02:32:15,279 --> 02:32:17,479
ovulation

2931
02:32:17,479 --> 02:32:19,640
and

2932
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:22,040
implantation it will not allow ovulation

2933
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:23,880
and implantation to

2934
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:26,240
occur there will not be ovulation there

2935
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:27,880

02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:22,359
progesterone estrogen level will come

2955
02:33:22,359 --> 02:33:23,960
down as they will come down there will

2956
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:27,920
be menstral cycle right so it was very

2957
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:30,479
difficult starting from

2958
02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:33,359
a ah

2959
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:36,080
no what was the name of that medicine

2960
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:40,040
are tell me now n n lto that is not done

2961
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:41,960
principal and processes n there's not an

2962
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:44,840
i pill there not an i pill I pill is

2963
02:33:44,840 --> 02:33:48,160
emergency contraceptive

2964
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:52,319
s croman is in

2965
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:57,880
sah s croman just just skipped from my

2966
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:11,520
mind H whatever it was so uh 21 days say

2967
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:14,399
we have to take this daily uh within the

2968
02:34:14,399 --> 02:34:16,399
first 5 days one has to start right

2969
02:34:16,399 --> 02:34:18,399
pills are there similarly one more

2970
02:34:18,399 --> 02:34:20,040
medicine is available in the market by

2971
02:34:20,040 --> 02:34:21,080
the name of

2972
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:24,359
sahili so we are so proud Sahel is

2973
02:34:24,359 --> 02:34:26,600
developed by

2974
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:31,000
cdri Central drug Research

2975
02:34:33,479 --> 02:34:37,479
Institute drug Research

2976
02:34:37,479 --> 02:34:41,520
Institute cdri which is in

2977
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:44,760
lakau central drug Research Institute

2978
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:48,200
which is in lakau and uh this is having

2979
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:51,600
this so they uh it's like once in a week

2980
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:55,279
so one one person has to take this once

2981
02:34:55,279 --> 02:34:56,720
in

2982
02:34:56,720 --> 02:35:01,120
week right this is

2983
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:07,120
nonsteroidal this is

2984
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:10,200
nonsteroidal they they have sent chroman

2985
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:12,640
as you have told me so let's discuss it

2986
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:15,000
has sent

2987
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,760
chroman

2988
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:20,240
sent chroman and sent chroman it blocks

2989
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:23,040
the estrogen

2990
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:27,920
receptor the

2991
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:30,920
estrogen

2992
02:35:33,720 --> 02:35:37,479
receptor it blocks the

2993
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:47,160
astrogenesis basic mechanism is they

2994
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:49,080
will inhibit ovulation and they will

2995
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:50,920
inhibit the implantation this is a oral

2996
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:53,319
contraceptive similarly injectables are

2997
02:35:53,319 --> 02:35:55,800
also available in the

2998
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:58,319
market injectables are also there so

2999
02:35:58,319 --> 02:36:01,640
injectables they are also U you know

3000
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:03,920
dimpa there are many available in the

3001
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:06,479
market and these injectables they are in

3002
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:08,120
the form of injection which contain the

3003
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:11,200
progesterone and estrogen so that's it

3004
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:13,560
okay so with this guys we have completed

3005
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:14,920
the methods of

3006
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:17,000
contraception intra utrine devices

3007
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,640
natural barrier Etc now we have to talk

3008
02:36:19,640 --> 02:36:23,720
about the surgical

3009
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:26,240
methods

3010
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:29,240
surgical

3011
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:32,720
methods the surgical methods are also

3012
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:37,760
there first is the tubic

3013
02:36:38,319 --> 02:36:43,399
toi and second is the

3014
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:46,560
vasectomy

3015
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:48,120
homy and

3016
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:53,000
vasectomy homy done by

3017
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,600
female so they

3018
02:36:57,399 --> 02:36:59,439
doctors

3019
02:36:59,439 --> 02:37:03,160
cut and

3020
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:07,000
tie fallopian

3021
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,439
tube Fallopian

3022
02:37:10,439 --> 02:37:14,800
tubes on both

3023
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:17,800
sides

3024
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:20,399
so so right these are the Fallopian

3025
02:37:20,399 --> 02:37:22,319
tubes so doctors they just make a cut

3026
02:37:22,319 --> 02:37:24,479
over here and they just tie this again

3027
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:27,359
so they'll tie this again so uh it's

3028
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:30,760
like they Block it's like a road and

3029
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:33,279
it's that road where the sperm one side

3030
02:37:33,279 --> 02:37:34,640
the sperm is coming and another side the

3031
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:36,520
egg is coming so they will block that

3032
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:38,720
road and ultimately what will happen

3033
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:41,960
there will not be any uh pregnancy now

3034
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:43,319
tell me and many students they come to

3035
02:37:43,319 --> 02:37:44,840
me and they say ma'am in this case there

3036
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:49,000
will not be menal Cy ccle what do you

3037
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:52,080
think come

3038
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:54,880
on will they be menal cycle in this yes

3039
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,760
there will be menal cycle definitely why

3040
02:37:56,760 --> 02:38:00,479
not there will be menal cycle only gamut

3041
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:03,479
cut yes cut the fallopian tube but here

3042
02:38:03,479 --> 02:38:05,720
menal cycle will be there female will

3043
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:08,880
undergo the same menal cycle vasectomy

3044
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:13,160
vasectomy we do in case of male where

3045
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:17,680
cut and tie

3046
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:19,560
the

3047
02:38:19,560 --> 02:38:22,560
vas

3048
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:27,479
Defence on both

3049
02:38:29,479 --> 02:38:33,120
sides both sides right these two methods

3050
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:36,920
surgical methods they are

3051
02:38:37,080 --> 02:38:40,080
non-reversible

3052
02:38:41,160 --> 02:38:43,640
nonreversible these are non-reversible

3053
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,800
method one cannot reverse this this is

3054
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:47,840
non-reversible both these methods okay

3055
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,720
once done that means done done done done

3056
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:51,920
that means there will be no

3057
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:53,640
pregnancy

3058
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:56,520
okay AA guys now I have to discuss this

3059
02:38:56,520 --> 02:39:01,520
amasis also with you what is amnios

3060
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:06,800
nasis yes gamut formation will

3061
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:09,600
occur a now you'll say in vask toi those

3062
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:12,000
who have done the vask to me uh so that

3063
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,960
means in that case there will not be uh

3064
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:16,840
sper formation there will be some sperm

3065
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:18,279
formation only the sperm will not come

3066
02:39:18,279 --> 02:39:20,880
out so either a in a couple either a

3067
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:22,640
female can go through the tubectomy or a

3068
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:24,680
male can go through the vasectomy right

3069
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:26,080
in case they do not

3070
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:30,880
want do not want any baby amnios

3071
02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:34,520
synthases amniocentesis so amniocentesis

3072
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:36,279
is the procedure by which any

3073
02:39:36,279 --> 02:39:38,760
chromosomal disability if it is there in

3074
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:41,279
the baby that can be detected easily

3075
02:39:41,279 --> 02:39:44,359
that can be detected right how in this

3076
02:39:44,359 --> 02:39:45,920
case what happens is when a child child

3077
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,800
is there in the mother's swarm right 18

3078
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:50,720
to 20 week gestation

3079
02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:52,920
at 18

3080
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:55,920
to 20

3081
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:59,560
weeks of

3082
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:03,840
gestation right suppose in a family in a

3083
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:08,279
family chances key there are diseases or

3084
02:40:08,279 --> 02:40:11,439
some gen genetic diseases are there in a

3085
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:13,120
family and couple wants to know whether

3086
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:14,680
their child will be suffering from that

3087
02:40:14,680 --> 02:40:16,800
thing or not so in that case they can go

3088
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:19,080
for amniocentesis so amasis is a

3089
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:21,200
procedure which is done under the

3090
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:23,880
ultrasound machine so this is ultrasound

3091
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:26,359
uh you know image so this is how it is

3092
02:40:26,359 --> 02:40:28,840
done and with the help of a syringe as

3093
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:30,840
you can see this is a baby and with the

3094
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:33,160
help of a

3095
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:36,240
syringe some fluid amniotic fluid will

3096
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:41,640
be taken out right gestation 16 to 18 um

3097
02:40:41,640 --> 02:40:44,160
like this week it depends like how much

3098
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:46,800
how enough amount of of amniotic fluid

3099
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:50,040
should be there in the mother's SW right

3100
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:57,240
so 4 to 6 mL of amniotic

3101
02:40:57,240 --> 02:41:02,319
fluid amniotic fluid we take

3102
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:06,560
out we take out with the help of a

3103
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:09,960
ultrasound transducer and by using a

3104
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:12,960
syinge either the syringe can be trans

3105
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:16,840
abdominal or can be trans vaginal

3106
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:20,479
right right now the fluid will be taken

3107
02:41:20,479 --> 02:41:26,319
out and then what will happen the

3108
02:41:26,319 --> 02:41:28,600
embryo

3109
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:31,560
cells will be

3110
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:34,760
collected will be

3111
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:37,200
collected now what we'll do we will

3112
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:40,479
check for the

3113
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:44,080
chromosomal

3114
02:41:44,439 --> 02:41:47,439
abnormalities

3115
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:54,920
we will check for chromosomal any

3116
02:41:54,920 --> 02:41:56,920
genetic

3117
02:41:56,920 --> 02:42:01,560
disorder or any genetic

3118
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:05,319
disorders we just can be analyzed they

3119
02:42:05,319 --> 02:42:07,920
can be easily analyzed that's it we will

3120
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:10,040
culture those cells and easily we can

3121
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:13,359
check out right now what all disease can

3122
02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:16,920
we carry hemophilia yes hemophilia can

3123
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:20,040
be analyzed isn't it Down syndrome prom

3124
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:22,240
of chomosome under 21 can be detected

3125
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:24,240
Turner syndrome if it is there the

3126
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:26,680
client client felter syndrome whether it

3127
02:42:26,680 --> 02:42:28,600
is there in the baby or not can be

3128
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:32,000
detected and when in normal cases me

3129
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,240
people do not go for

3130
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:37,279
amasis why people do not go for amasis

3131
02:42:37,279 --> 02:42:40,240
the reason is it's not required but when

3132
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:42,479
they feel in the pedigree this disease

3133
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:44,000
is there and they do not want that their

3134
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,080
child should have this dis disease in

3135
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:48,439
that case they can go for an entosis now

3136
02:42:48,439 --> 02:42:49,800
we are very sharp we are very

3137
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:51,120
intelligent now we are using this

3138
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:54,680
amniocentesis procedure for the sex

3139
02:42:54,680 --> 02:42:57,120
determination because chromosomes are

3140
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:58,319
there so with the help of chromosome

3141
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:00,279
analysis we can get to know whether XX

3142
02:43:00,279 --> 02:43:03,279
is there or XY is there XY is there Oho

3143
02:43:03,279 --> 02:43:05,760
by it's a boy very nice if it is a

3144
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:09,000
female then female fitti side right so

3145
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,760
that is illegal now AMD syntaxis for

3146
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:15,479
checking the sex is illegal in our

3147
02:43:15,479 --> 02:43:18,720
country but in other countries it is

3148
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:22,760
legal yes is that so so see it's a

3149
02:43:22,760 --> 02:43:24,760
medical procedure used in prenatal

3150
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:26,840
diagnosis of chromosome amoli fetal

3151
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:28,840
infection and sex determination but for

3152
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:31,640
sex determination it is not used okay so

3153
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:34,240
this is ultrasound transducer baby

3154
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:35,920
Position will be checked and with the

3155
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:38,960
help of a fine nle the amniotic fluid

3156
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,439
will be taken out this is a trans

3157
02:43:40,439 --> 02:43:42,479
abdominal like this a trans vaginal can

3158
02:43:42,479 --> 02:43:43,640
also be

3159
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:47,760
done yes we cannot detect the Clift

3160
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:52,840
pallet oh yes okay okay okay let's move

3161
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:55,520
on next now whates let's move on to the

3162
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:58,120
next topic which is

3163
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:01,319
the medical termination of

3164
02:44:01,319 --> 02:44:03,800
pregnancy female f female is there in

3165
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:05,520
mother's SW now what will people do

3166
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:08,160
people will go for a female feticide in

3167
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,920
our country not here everywhere but in

3168
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:13,200
some states the sex ratio is badly

3169
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:15,359
affected number of female to that of

3170
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:19,319
male is really very very very less why

3171
02:44:19,319 --> 02:44:22,479
because they feel now why that you all

3172
02:44:22,479 --> 02:44:24,600
know people feel female is a burden

3173
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:27,439
female will this will that Etc and Etc

3174
02:44:27,439 --> 02:44:31,840
okay so people can go for a uh so MTP

3175
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:33,960
here in India is

3176
02:44:33,960 --> 02:44:36,000
legalized medical termination of

3177
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,040
pregnancy or abortion in India is

3178
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:40,279
legalized this is not legalized for this

3179
02:44:40,279 --> 02:44:44,279
reason we have more uh people we have

3180
02:44:44,279 --> 02:44:46,200
the population is really very very high

3181
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:49,399
it is for the other reason right so MTP

3182
02:44:49,399 --> 02:44:51,640
was not M MTP is not a method of

3183
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:54,279
contraception again I'm saying okay

3184
02:44:54,279 --> 02:44:56,000
intentional or voluntary termination of

3185
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,600
pregnancy is called medical termination

3186
02:44:57,600 --> 02:44:59,160
of pregnancy medical termination of

3187
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:01,000
pregnancy is also termed as abortion

3188
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:04,200
these are the lines from your ncrt okay

3189
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:06,399
mtps are used to get rid of unwanted

3190
02:45:06,399 --> 02:45:09,319
pregnancies for example in case of rape

3191
02:45:09,319 --> 02:45:12,319
right in case people want to do not want

3192
02:45:12,319 --> 02:45:14,080
a baby so in that case they can go for

3193
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:16,960
an MTP pregnancy which could be harmful

3194
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:19,240
fatal to mother and the fetus or both

3195
02:45:19,240 --> 02:45:23,399
suppose in the suppose um you know

3196
02:45:23,399 --> 02:45:25,160
ectopic pregnancy is there can anyone

3197
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:28,160
tell me what is ectopic

3198
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:32,640
pregnancy that will be uh in the next

3199
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:35,080
session the bota session that will be

3200
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:37,720
tomorrow so we will teach this chapter

3201
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:40,520
CH come on tell me what is ectopic

3202
02:45:40,520 --> 02:45:43,640
pregnancy come on what is ectopic

3203
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:47,760
pregnancy come on tell me come on come

3204
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,279
on when a baby is in fallopian tube when

3205
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:03,560
baby is anywhere but not in uterus

3206
02:46:03,560 --> 02:46:06,080
anywhere but not in uterus so that is

3207
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:09,880
termed as ectopic pregnancy yes

3208
02:46:09,880 --> 02:46:12,479
pregnancy anywhere in other than uterus

3209
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:14,160
that is termed as ectopic pregnancy not

3210
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:16,760
only in fop

3211
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,880
okay so in that case what will happen

3212
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:21,319
why why did I tell you ke U after

3213
02:46:21,319 --> 02:46:23,560
getting a positive test on that strip

3214
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:25,479
one should go for ultrasound the reason

3215
02:46:25,479 --> 02:46:28,120
is to get to know whe whether ectopic

3216
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:30,439
pregnancy is there or not if ectopic

3217
02:46:30,439 --> 02:46:32,720
pregnancy is this this is fatal for a

3218
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:34,960
mother as well as baby in that case one

3219
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:37,439
has to go through the MTP they have to

3220
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:41,960
abort that baby now mtps are safe up to

3221
02:46:41,960 --> 02:46:44,359
12 weeks the first trimester of the of

3222
02:46:44,359 --> 02:46:48,040
the baby we have legalized MTP in 1971

3223
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:50,040
reproductive and child healthare program

3224
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:52,080
was started in

3225
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:56,319
1951 MTP is legalized in India here it

3226
02:46:56,319 --> 02:47:00,520
was legalized in

3227
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:04,040
1971 40 to 55 million mtps are done in

3228
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:06,200
year throughout world which is 1/5th of

3229
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:10,200
the total pregnancy when one uh you know

3230
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:11,920
first trimester is there there will be

3231
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:14,080
one medical practitioner and that

3232
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:16,640
medical practitioner will be uh with the

3233
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:18,279
help of various methods there are

3234
02:47:18,279 --> 02:47:20,040
various methods like diretion and cute

3235
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:23,720
rages U introduction of prostag glin or

3236
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:25,760
by the surgical procedur depending upon

3237
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:29,000
at which stage the baby is one can go

3238
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:32,040
for an MTP so that is always that will

3239
02:47:32,040 --> 02:47:34,319
be prescribed by doctor only and one

3240
02:47:34,319 --> 02:47:36,080
should not again I'm saying I'm saying

3241
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:37,600
this on public

3242
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:42,120
platform no one should buy these MTB

3243
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:45,399
drugs directly from a medical store

3244
02:47:45,399 --> 02:47:48,920
without prescription no guys it's really

3245
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:53,439
harmful and it can be fatal to a mother

3246
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:56,880
okay now significance it helps in

3247
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:58,600
getting rid of unwanted pregnancy such

3248
02:47:58,600 --> 02:48:01,040
pregnancies which can be harmful and

3249
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:02,800
this is significant role in decreasing

3250
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:05,600
the human population though it is not

3251
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:07,760
made for decreasing the population in

3252
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:10,040
many cases what doctors do is Doctor

3253
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:11,760
cuts the baby within the uterus into

3254
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:14,120
small small pieces and then with the

3255
02:48:14,120 --> 02:48:16,000
help of a vacuum they take out each and

3256
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,720
every part so that is also one of the

3257
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:19,399
part if this could have been a normal

3258
02:48:19,399 --> 02:48:20,760
session I would have explained you the

3259
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:23,279
different type also but it's okay though

3260
02:48:23,279 --> 02:48:25,319
it's not a part but it's very good to

3261
02:48:25,319 --> 02:48:29,000
study these also okay now it is being

3262
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
misused to abort even the normal female

3263
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,319
fetus female feticide majority are

3264
02:48:33,319 --> 02:48:36,040
performed illegally by unqualified quack

3265
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:38,560
which can be fatal it raise emotional

3266
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:40,960
ethical religious and social

3267
02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:43,680
issues okay guys now we have to move

3268
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:47,439
towards the next topic which is the

3269
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:52,279

diseases reproductive tract infections

3297
02:50:26,120 --> 02:50:30,760
RTI clear so how does it spread it you

3298
02:50:30,760 --> 02:50:34,640
know we all know about HIV right we all

3299
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:38,800
know about HIV in around 1981 this first

3300
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:42,439
case came and this first came uh so so

3301
02:50:42,439 --> 02:50:44,760
I'll tell you a story in 1981 so so

3302
02:50:44,760 --> 02:50:47,359
there were group of people so those

3303
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:50,359
group of people they were uh uh you they

3304
02:50:50,359 --> 02:50:54,359
were taking some intravenous drugs so it

3305
02:50:54,359 --> 02:50:57,200
was like some party was going on and one

3306
02:50:57,200 --> 02:51:00,399
one of them he was taking that drug and

3307
02:51:00,399 --> 02:51:02,560
with that same syringe other also they

3308
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:05,279
started sharing it after some time it

3309
02:51:05,279 --> 02:51:07,319
was realized all of them they were

3310
02:51:07,319 --> 02:51:09,080
getting the Toxoplasma infection they

3311
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:10,920
were getting the tuberculosis they were

3312
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:13,920
getting other infections also uh so many

3313
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:15,880
people they came to this idea because

3314
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:18,200
they were into drugs they they used to

3315
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:19,479
take drugs that is the reason their

3316
02:51:19,479 --> 02:51:22,319
immune system is low with time doctors

3317
02:51:22,319 --> 02:51:24,600
they did deep study in this and they

3318
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:28,040
realized it is because of the HIV HIV is

3319
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:29,560
that virus which spread through the

3320
02:51:29,560 --> 02:51:32,279
sexual it spread uh it's an STD which

3321
02:51:32,279 --> 02:51:34,319
spread through the sexual contact and it

3322
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:36,200
also it doesn't mean that it only spread

3323
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:38,200
through the sexual contact it spread

3324
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:40,840
through the other ways also and because

3325
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:43,680
they were taking the same nles so with

3326
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:46,239
that it's spread to one person to

3327
02:51:46,239 --> 02:51:49,720
another it was really very U the you

3328
02:51:49,720 --> 02:51:51,920
know it's you know the HIV today we do

3329
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:54,359
not have any cure for HIV isn't it we

3330
02:51:54,359 --> 02:51:56,160
can only increase the life of a person

3331
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:59,720
but today cure is not possible but these

3332
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:02,279
STDs not only spread through a sexual

3333
02:52:02,279 --> 02:52:03,800
contact they spread through other

3334
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:05,960
contact also sharing the needles or the

3335
02:52:05,960 --> 02:52:07,680
surgical instrument contaminated with

3336
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:10,600
the infective blood suppose you go to a

3337
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:13,640
dentist and vess to everyone all doctors

3338
02:52:13,640 --> 02:52:15,880
they follow this suppose the instruments

3339
02:52:15,880 --> 02:52:18,200
they are not clear are not uh you know

3340
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:20,439
properly washed in that case the chances

3341
02:52:20,439 --> 02:52:22,479
that yes it can spread so all the

3342
02:52:22,479 --> 02:52:25,040
surgical instrument should be uh

3343
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:27,680
properly sterilized transfusion of

3344
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:29,520
contaminated blood suppose one person is

3345
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:32,200
suffering from any sexually STD it can

3346
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:34,840
spread from one person to another okay

3347
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:37,080
now next is STDs can also be transmitted

3348
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:39,080
from an infected mother to fetus if a

3349
02:52:39,080 --> 02:52:41,399
mother is suffering baby can also suffer

3350
02:52:41,399 --> 02:52:43,680
fetus disease which are transmitted

3351
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:45,040
through the sexual intercourse with the

3352
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:46,560
infected person are called sexually

3353
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:48,520
transmitt diseases venal diseases or

3354
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:50,439
reproductive tract infection but all are

3355
02:52:50,439 --> 02:52:52,800
not reproductive tra infection for

3356
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:55,279
example in case of AIDS HIV May

3357
02:52:55,279 --> 02:52:57,200
reproductive track infection doesn't

3358
02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:00,479
occur examples are goria ceris genital

3359
02:53:00,479 --> 02:53:03,080
herpes genital warts hepatitis AIDS

3360
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:05,200
clamidia are sexually transmitted

3361
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:07,399
diseases do you want to know the ctive

3362
02:53:07,399 --> 02:53:09,319
agent name it's not there in cabus but

3363
02:53:09,319 --> 02:53:11,720
still I'm telling you yes placenta say

3364
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:15,600
spread now gonor is neria gonor

3365
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:20,080
bacterial disease syphilis the tripona

3366
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:22,479
palum genital herpes herpes simplex

3367
02:53:22,479 --> 02:53:26,040
virus human Poma virus hepatitis virus

3368
02:53:26,040 --> 02:53:29,640
uh HIV clamidia romaus these are the

3369
02:53:29,640 --> 02:53:32,840
diseases out of this which one is

3370
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:35,680
non-curable which one is non-curable

3371
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:37,520
come on tell me genital herpes

3372
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:40,000
non-curable hepatitis non-curable and

3373
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,800
AIDS is non-curable rest all are curable

3374
02:53:42,800 --> 02:53:45,319
so what are the different uh symptoms

3375
02:53:45,319 --> 02:53:48,359
basically the discharge from the uh you

3376
02:53:48,359 --> 02:53:50,720

02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,800
these all diseases except the three

3386
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:16,279

can go for cionic Willa sampling

3471
02:59:06,880 --> 02:59:09,960
CVS cionic V sampling may we take out at

3472
02:59:09,960 --> 02:59:12,640

want then in that case is cionic Villa

3474
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:25,439
sampling great let's start let's start

3475
02:59:25,439 --> 02:59:26,720

infertility 40% female May infertility

3500
03:00:56,080 --> 03:00:58,080
yes sterility is the one which cannot be

3501
03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:00,279
cured infertility can be cured there are

3502
03:01:00,279 --> 03:01:01,960
various things like in the case of

3503
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:04,120
female so I'll discuss here it's not

3504
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:06,680
there in cabus but still discuss female

3505
03:01:06,680 --> 03:01:08,680
May what can happen is female May there

3506
03:01:08,680 --> 03:01:12,080
can be the uh you know the some fibroids

3507
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:14,120
are there in the uterus there are

3508
03:01:14,120 --> 03:01:16,319
chances key there's a tuberculosis of

3509
03:01:16,319 --> 03:01:18,399
Fallopian tube Fallopian tubes are

3510
03:01:18,399 --> 03:01:20,319
blocked so many reasons are there

3511
03:01:20,319 --> 03:01:21,760
menstrual cycle is not occurring

3512
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:24,120
properly there there are reasons in male

3513
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:26,520
there can be Aus spermia zeros sperm uh

3514
03:01:26,520 --> 03:01:28,680
sperm motility is not there the sperm

3515
03:01:28,680 --> 03:01:32,000
shape is not proper or there is no sperm

3516
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,439
in the semon so many reasons are there

3517
03:01:34,439 --> 03:01:36,239
right in that case one can go for

3518
03:01:36,239 --> 03:01:38,720
assisted reproductive Technologies the

3519
03:01:38,720 --> 03:01:41,359
art techniques

3520
03:01:41,359 --> 03:01:44,399
right so let's discuss

3521
03:01:44,399 --> 03:01:45,840
a

3522
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:48,600
r

3523
03:01:48,600 --> 03:01:51,600
assisted

3524
03:01:55,560 --> 03:01:58,439
reproductive

3525
03:01:58,439 --> 03:02:01,439
techno

3526
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:03,840
logies assisted reproductive

3527
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:05,640
Technologies are those Technologies

3528
03:02:05,640 --> 03:02:10,239
which are actually ban for those couple

3529
03:02:10,239 --> 03:02:12,880
uh who are suffering from infertility

3530
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:15,080
specifically

3531
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:18,760
uh either in male or female right in

3532
03:02:18,760 --> 03:02:20,520
this case one word that comes in

3533
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:24,439
everyone's mind is the test tube

3534
03:02:24,439 --> 03:02:26,800
baby test tube

3535
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:29,800
baby but this word test tube baby itself

3536
03:02:29,800 --> 03:02:33,080
is a misn noral so let's start let's

3537
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:35,479
start discussing so here in assisted

3538
03:02:35,479 --> 03:02:37,920
reproductive technology from a female

3539
03:02:37,920 --> 03:02:40,960
body we take out

3540
03:02:40,960 --> 03:02:45,319
egg right from a male we take out

3541
03:02:45,319 --> 03:02:47,239
sperm

3542
03:02:47,239 --> 03:02:51,040
sperm what we do we collect

3543
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:56,439
them we collect them then we fertilize

3544
03:02:56,439 --> 03:02:58,720
in

3545
03:02:59,600 --> 03:03:03,600
lab fertilize in laboratory condition

3546
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:05,680
right when we fertilize them in

3547
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:10,239
laboratory condition then we

3548
03:03:11,160 --> 03:03:15,479
implant the

3549
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:21,640
blastocyst in

3550
03:03:22,520 --> 03:03:27,680
uterus this is what we call test tube

3551
03:03:31,399 --> 03:03:35,200
baby up female say we collected egg male

3552
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:36,800
say we collected sperm we fertilized

3553
03:03:36,800 --> 03:03:38,960
them in lab and then we transplant it

3554
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:41,520
back into the female body this we call

3555
03:03:41,520 --> 03:03:44,439
it as as testu

3556
03:03:44,439 --> 03:03:47,120
baby right this we call it as test tube

3557
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:49,840
baby now tell me anywhere did I use the

3558
03:03:49,840 --> 03:03:52,840
word test tube no right but that is the

3559
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:54,760
reason this word is a misn noral test

3560
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:56,840
tube word is used because they are the

3561
03:03:56,840 --> 03:03:58,600
babies who are produced in the lab so

3562
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:00,160
they are like a normal babies only

3563
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:01,600
they're not something different they are

3564
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:03,160
not like aliens they are normal babies

3565
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:06,120
only so this is the overall procedure so

3566
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:07,840
I'll explain tasa this procedure in

3567
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:10,479
detail because nowadays every third to

3568
03:04:10,479 --> 03:04:12,439
fourth person couple they are suffering

3569
03:04:12,439 --> 03:04:14,800
from MDES because of the late marriages

3570
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:17,200
because of the poor hygiene practices

3571
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:19,000
and the most important reason is the

3572
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,520
adulteration the food which we take so

3573
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:23,520
from the female egg is collected how can

3574
03:04:23,520 --> 03:04:25,840
we collect the egg so it is like

3575
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:28,279
normally a female produces one egg in a

3576
03:04:28,279 --> 03:04:31,439
month by continuous injection of FSH

3577
03:04:31,439 --> 03:04:33,239
follicular stimulating hormone not only

3578
03:04:33,239 --> 03:04:35,960
one follicle in fact 28 29 follicles

3579
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:40,080
develop in female 28 29 follicle and

3580
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:42,120
every day whenever she takes injection

3581
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:45,040
female Co the the doctors they actually

3582
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:48,120
look uh they keep a close eye on

3583
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:51,319
her ovaries like how many eggs they are

3584
03:04:51,319 --> 03:04:54,080
developing right ultimately at the

3585
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:56,640
retrieval day they retrieve egg from a

3586
03:04:56,640 --> 03:04:59,479
female right many times they are able to

3587
03:04:59,479 --> 03:05:02,359
get seven 8 9 10 eggs many times they

3588
03:05:02,359 --> 03:05:03,920
can get a one or two

3589
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:06,359
egg from the male the sperms they are

3590
03:05:06,359 --> 03:05:08,800
collected right there are various ways

3591
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:13,600
if female is you know if male is fine B

3592
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:15,080
is not suffering from anything in that

3593
03:05:15,080 --> 03:05:16,520
case there is there are normal ways of

3594
03:05:16,520 --> 03:05:19,359
collecting sperms which you all know but

3595
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:21,680
when sperms are not there in the semon

3596
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:23,880
what sperms are there in the test is by

3597
03:05:23,880 --> 03:05:26,880
Tisa there are various methods by a

3598
03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:29,120
vacuum aspiration or other methods

3599
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:31,040
surgical methods the sperms they are

3600
03:05:31,040 --> 03:05:33,479
being taken out from the testest sperms

3601
03:05:33,479 --> 03:05:35,560
will be collected now what will happen

3602
03:05:35,560 --> 03:05:37,080
egg and sperm they will

3603
03:05:37,080 --> 03:05:40,000
be they will be allowed to meet they

3604
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,239
will be allowed to fertilize so for the

3605
03:05:42,239 --> 03:05:44,160
fertilization we use use one procedure

3606
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:46,080
which is

3607
03:05:46,080 --> 03:05:51,399
ixie that is intracytoplasmic sperm

3608
03:05:52,399 --> 03:05:56,800
injection intra

3609
03:05:56,920 --> 03:06:01,040
cytoplasmic sperm injection so it is

3610
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:03,680
like we hold a

3611
03:06:03,680 --> 03:06:07,120
egg we hold a egg and we give a

3612
03:06:07,120 --> 03:06:09,399
injection of

3613
03:06:09,399 --> 03:06:13,439
a sperm like this intracytoplasmic sperm

3614
03:06:13,439 --> 03:06:17,040
injection then we when then we prepare a

3615
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,520
blastocyst in the lab and then we

3616
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:21,960
implant this into the baby sorry mother

3617
03:06:21,960 --> 03:06:24,840
BB CH now let's talk about the different

3618
03:06:24,840 --> 03:06:26,800
type of

3619
03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:31,520
Arts right assisted reproductive

3620
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:33,760
technology so assisted reproductive

3621
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:36,479
Technologies they are of various type

3622
03:06:36,479 --> 03:06:39,120
first is in

3623
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:42,120
Vivo

3624
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:44,279
fertilization

3625
03:06:44,279 --> 03:06:47,120
in Vivo

3626
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:49,399
fertilization and second thing is

3627
03:06:49,399 --> 03:06:52,239
invitro

3628
03:06:56,399 --> 03:06:59,279
fertilization in Vivo fertilization and

3629
03:06:59,279 --> 03:07:00,399
invo

3630
03:07:00,399 --> 03:07:03,439
fertilization right Ino fertilization

3631
03:07:03,439 --> 03:07:05,880
that means these are the methods by

3632
03:07:05,880 --> 03:07:08,439
which

3633
03:07:08,439 --> 03:07:12,120
fertilization we do in the body of

3634
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:14,479
female

3635
03:07:14,479 --> 03:07:18,600
in female

3636
03:07:20,239 --> 03:07:22,520
body Fertilization in female body and

3637
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:25,239
today I'll giving you all the cheats

3638
03:07:25,239 --> 03:07:28,800
also so

3639
03:07:28,800 --> 03:07:34,120
first gift first method is gift gift who

3640
03:07:34,120 --> 03:07:36,840
likes gift who likes gift girls like

3641
03:07:36,840 --> 03:07:40,760
gift girls like to gift right so gift is

3642
03:07:40,760 --> 03:07:44,239
done in case of female in case of female

3643
03:07:44,239 --> 03:07:46,720
who are not able to produce egg so this

3644
03:07:46,720 --> 03:07:48,359
is

3645
03:07:48,359 --> 03:07:55,160
done in female who cannot produce

3646
03:07:55,960 --> 03:07:57,800
egg

3647
03:07:57,800 --> 03:08:01,680
cannot produce

3648
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:04,160
eggs those who are not able to produce

3649
03:08:04,160 --> 03:08:07,160
egg we give them gift so what is a gift

3650
03:08:07,160 --> 03:08:08,720
yeah write down the full form of gift in

3651
03:08:08,720 --> 03:08:11,200
the comment section write down the full

3652
03:08:11,200 --> 03:08:15,040
form of gift

3653
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:20,479
gamet

3654
03:08:20,479 --> 03:08:23,439
intra

3655
03:08:23,439 --> 03:08:26,439
fallopian

3656
03:08:28,439 --> 03:08:32,200
transfer clear gift right now in that

3657
03:08:32,200 --> 03:08:35,680
case what do we do we

3658
03:08:35,680 --> 03:08:41,600
collect egg eggs from

3659
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:45,000
donor

3660
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:49,000
right then those who want to be a mother

3661
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:53,920
we transfer the in fact doctor transfer

3662
03:08:53,920 --> 03:08:55,600
the

3663
03:08:55,600 --> 03:09:00,399
egg in fallopian

3664
03:09:00,399 --> 03:09:03,800
tube who fallopian tube the mother

3665
03:09:03,800 --> 03:09:07,120
fallopian tube Who Wants To Be A Mother

3666
03:09:07,120 --> 03:09:10,880
so this is a gift gift is for the female

3667
03:09:10,880 --> 03:09:13,920
done in female who cannot produce eggs

3668
03:09:13,920 --> 03:09:16,479
right now the next procedure this is the

3669
03:09:16,479 --> 03:09:20,160
first one let's talk about the next one

3670
03:09:20,160 --> 03:09:24,439
that is the artificial

3671
03:09:33,080 --> 03:09:34,880
insemination

3672
03:09:34,880 --> 03:09:37,439
or

3673
03:09:37,439 --> 03:09:41,000
intra uterine

3674
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:44,920
IUI insemination

3675
03:09:49,319 --> 03:09:52,840
now suppose now this is done in case of

3676
03:09:52,840 --> 03:09:54,800
a female or sorry a male whose sperm

3677
03:09:54,800 --> 03:09:57,279
count is less right in that case we

3678
03:09:57,279 --> 03:10:00,720
collect sperm from female sperm for male

3679
03:10:00,720 --> 03:10:03,840
and then we extract good sperm healthy

3680
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:06,359
sperm M motile sperm into the female

3681
03:10:06,359 --> 03:10:09,920
body right so

3682
03:10:11,359 --> 03:10:14,840
here BS

3683
03:10:16,960 --> 03:10:19,200
collected

3684
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:21,840
from

3685
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:25,680
male then

3686
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:31,080
artificially

3687
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:36,399
introduced in

3688
03:10:36,399 --> 03:10:38,840
female at

3689
03:10:38,840 --> 03:10:41,319
ovulation

3690
03:10:41,319 --> 03:10:43,479
time ovulation

3691
03:10:43,479 --> 03:10:46,080
time now this is done also in that case

3692
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:48,760
when we need a sperm donor when we need

3693
03:10:48,760 --> 03:10:52,439
a sperm Doner yeah this is gift so here

3694
03:10:52,439 --> 03:10:54,600
in fertilization is happening where is

3695
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:55,880
fertilization see egg is there in

3696
03:10:55,880 --> 03:10:57,479
fallopian tube egg is there so

3697
03:10:57,479 --> 03:10:59,479
Fertilization in fallopian tube sperm we

3698
03:10:59,479 --> 03:11:02,160
are introducing here right so this is

3699
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:04,319
also artificial examination now let's

3700
03:11:04,319 --> 03:11:06,680
talk about the invivo

3701
03:11:06,680 --> 03:11:09,520
fertilization invitro fertilization so

3702
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:12,439
in invitro fertilization first we are

3703
03:11:12,439 --> 03:11:17,279
having is gift sorry

3704
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:25,520
zift zft so what is zift

3705
03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:29,800
zygote

3706
03:11:30,439 --> 03:11:33,120
intra

3707
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:36,120
fallopian

3708
03:11:36,600 --> 03:11:39,720
transfer zygote intrafallopian transfer

3709
03:11:39,720 --> 03:11:42,359
zygote intrafallopian transfer so here

3710
03:11:42,359 --> 03:11:46,880
what do we we do is we take egg from

3711
03:11:46,880 --> 03:11:50,720
female right from female we collect egg

3712
03:11:50,720 --> 03:11:56,600
right clear we from the male we collect

3713
03:11:57,120 --> 03:11:59,040
sperms

3714
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:03,279
collected then fertilize we will get a

3715
03:12:03,279 --> 03:12:07,760
zygote and zygote we will transfer to

3716
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:09,319
uterus

3717
03:12:09,319 --> 03:12:11,680
sorry fallopian

3718
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:14,680
tube

3719
03:12:16,359 --> 03:12:19,359
fallopian

3720
03:12:19,399 --> 03:12:22,279
tube right here we are transferring the

3721
03:12:22,279 --> 03:12:24,399
zygote here what is there fertilization

3722
03:12:24,399 --> 03:12:27,080
is occuring in the lab initro initro

3723
03:12:27,080 --> 03:12:30,080
means Fertilization in the

3724
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:32,840
lab okay

3725
03:12:32,840 --> 03:12:36,520
clear y you guys talk a lot I don't know

3726
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:41,080
what do you eat so next

3727
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:44,359
one now next is what is the next one

3728
03:12:44,359 --> 03:12:48,319
zygote is done Embryo

3729
03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:52,920
transfer Embryo

3730
03:12:53,239 --> 03:12:56,520
transfer ET right

3731
03:12:56,520 --> 03:13:01,600
or intra uterine transfer iut should I

3732
03:13:01,600 --> 03:13:03,279
write the full

3733
03:13:03,279 --> 03:13:06,080
form

3734
03:13:06,080 --> 03:13:08,399
intra

3735
03:13:08,399 --> 03:13:11,399
uterine

3736
03:13:11,560 --> 03:13:13,080
transfer

3737
03:13:13,080 --> 03:13:15,359
intrauterine transfer okay now

3738
03:13:15,359 --> 03:13:17,760
intrauterine transfer May what do we do

3739
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:24,479
see we take again female say egg egg

3740
03:13:24,479 --> 03:13:27,120
retrieval male say we will collect

3741
03:13:27,120 --> 03:13:31,040
sperms we will fertilize them in the lab

3742
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:32,439
we will get a

3743
03:13:32,439 --> 03:13:37,399
zygote and zygote say we will make a

3744
03:13:39,319 --> 03:13:44,560
embryo more than eight cell stage

3745
03:13:44,760 --> 03:13:46,720
eight cell

3746
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:52,200
stage we will transfer this into the

3747
03:13:52,279 --> 03:13:56,600
uterus of female May transfer yes that

3748
03:13:56,600 --> 03:13:59,040
is the reason so here we will transfer

3749
03:13:59,040 --> 03:14:01,479
this into the fallopian tube zygote or

3750
03:14:01,479 --> 03:14:04,920
up to 8 cell

3751
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:07,680
stage up to 8 cell stage we will

3752
03:14:07,680 --> 03:14:09,640
transfer into the fopen tube more than

3753
03:14:09,640 --> 03:14:10,800
eight cell stage we are going to

3754
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:14,479
transfer into the uterus

3755
03:14:15,560 --> 03:14:18,319
huh it s it blast same same same same

3756
03:14:18,319 --> 03:14:23,080
same same same same same same AR

3757
03:14:23,080 --> 03:14:27,840
yeah okay see how good your revision is

3758
03:14:27,840 --> 03:14:30,080
going

3759
03:14:30,239 --> 03:14:33,720
on enjoying everyone

3760
03:14:33,720 --> 03:14:36,960
yes yes

3761
03:14:41,479 --> 03:14:43,040
Buddies

3762
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:45,239
so art is that technique for this we

3763
03:14:45,239 --> 03:14:48,760
have special technician embryologist are

3764
03:14:48,760 --> 03:14:50,359
there who take care of embryon it's

3765
03:14:50,359 --> 03:14:52,920
really very difficult job they remain in

3766
03:14:52,920 --> 03:14:54,960
laboratory until unless a baby is fully

3767
03:14:54,960 --> 03:14:57,279
developed and then they freeze it also

3768
03:14:57,279 --> 03:14:59,560
it's is it is having a you know it's

3769
03:14:59,560 --> 03:15:02,920
a it will it's a great help to those who

3770
03:15:02,920 --> 03:15:05,120
cannot have their own baby and it's

3771
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:11,399
important for U yeah right INF fertility

3772
03:15:11,399 --> 03:15:12,960
treatment

3773
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:15,920
okay

3774
03:15:18,439 --> 03:15:20,239
clear

3775
03:15:20,239 --> 03:15:22,560
okay let's

3776
03:15:22,560 --> 03:15:25,399
start so guys with this we have

3777
03:15:25,399 --> 03:15:27,640
completed this chapter also reproductive

3778
03:15:27,640 --> 03:15:29,439
Health now we have to start another

3779
03:15:29,439 --> 03:15:31,840
chapter which is evolution shall we

3780
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:34,279
start or do you want a break come on

3781
03:15:34,279 --> 03:15:35,279
tell

3782
03:15:35,279 --> 03:15:39,640
me shall we start or do you want a

3783
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,479
break you want a break or shall we start

3784
03:15:43,479 --> 03:15:45,920
come on tell

3785
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:53,279
me no

3786
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,800
break okay then I guess then we can

3787
03:16:03,800 --> 03:16:08,640
start the chapter Evolution no

3788
03:16:09,960 --> 03:16:14,319
break okay

3789
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:25,960
let's

3790
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:28,560
start hey it's okay now let's start this

3791
03:16:28,560 --> 03:16:32,399
chapter and uh I'll give you break at 4

3792
03:16:32,399 --> 03:16:35,680
okay at 4 we will take a

3793
03:16:35,680 --> 03:16:39,800
break okay so let's start

3794
03:16:39,800 --> 03:16:42,760
Evolution so what is evolution and what

3795
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:45,080
are we going to study in this chapter

3796
03:16:45,080 --> 03:16:48,680
now evolution is all about evolving the

3797
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:51,800
life forms which exist today humans dogs

3798
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:54,960
elephant some fishes animals whosoever

3799
03:16:54,960 --> 03:16:56,840
are there on the Earth's surface they

3800
03:16:56,840 --> 03:16:59,080
were not like they were not same if I

3801
03:16:59,080 --> 03:17:01,760
talk about a millions of years back and

3802
03:17:01,760 --> 03:17:04,399
if I talk about how these organisms they

3803
03:17:04,399 --> 03:17:06,000
came on the Earth's surface that itself

3804
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:09,080
is a big thing and we don't have a time

3805
03:17:09,080 --> 03:17:10,800
machine to go back to that particular

3806
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:13,920
time era to get to know what individual

3807
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:17,160
used to exist at that time so we have

3808
03:17:17,160 --> 03:17:18,560
some evidences and with the help of

3809
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:21,000
evidences we can get to know that these

3810
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:24,800
species used to exist at that time but

3811
03:17:24,800 --> 03:17:26,600
if you look at those organism and if you

3812
03:17:26,600 --> 03:17:28,439
look at these organism which exist today

3813
03:17:28,439 --> 03:17:29,880
there's huge

3814
03:17:29,880 --> 03:17:33,120
difference yes because with time they

3815
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:34,800
were exposed to different environmental

3816
03:17:34,800 --> 03:17:36,160
condition they

3817
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:38,920
developed and now we have different

3818
03:17:38,920 --> 03:17:40,840
organisms all

3819
03:17:40,840 --> 03:17:43,760
today every thing comes under the

3820
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:46,120
science which is evolutionary biology so

3821
03:17:46,120 --> 03:17:48,399
let's start so what is an evolution

3822
03:17:48,399 --> 03:17:50,720
Evolution or evolutionary biology it's a

3823
03:17:50,720 --> 03:17:53,080
branch of science with time you can

3824
03:17:53,080 --> 03:17:54,920
after 12th you can pursue your career

3825
03:17:54,920 --> 03:17:58,479
also in this now branch of science for

3826
03:17:58,479 --> 03:18:00,600
the study of origin of Life evolution of

3827
03:18:00,600 --> 03:18:02,439
different life form of Earth is called

3828
03:18:02,439 --> 03:18:05,080
as bio Evolution or evolutionary biology

3829
03:18:05,080 --> 03:18:07,279
by

3830
03:18:07,279 --> 03:18:11,120
Mir yes

3831
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:13,040
no

3832
03:18:13,040 --> 03:18:16,040
let's start first first we have to talk

3833
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:19,040
about the origin of life

3834
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:22,279
now before starting how life evolved on

3835
03:18:22,279 --> 03:18:24,080
the Earth's surface let's first talk

3836
03:18:24,080 --> 03:18:27,479
about how Universe started forming we

3837
03:18:27,479 --> 03:18:30,000
all know about the theory the most uh

3838
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:32,560
important theory that is The Big Bang

3839
03:18:32,560 --> 03:18:35,520
Theory so big bang name itself indicate

3840
03:18:35,520 --> 03:18:37,439
that there was a huge explosion and

3841
03:18:37,439 --> 03:18:40,080
because of that huge explosion today we

3842
03:18:40,080 --> 03:18:42,680
have stars we have Galaxy

3843
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:44,520
and in the Milky Way galaxies we have is

3844
03:18:44,520 --> 03:18:47,840
a earth now it states that the Universe

3845
03:18:47,840 --> 03:18:51,160
originated around 20 billions years ago

3846
03:18:51,160 --> 03:18:55,399
and that to by a huge explosion a huge

3847
03:18:55,399 --> 03:18:57,840
bum blast happened and because of the

3848
03:18:57,840 --> 03:19:00,920
this huge B bum blast today we have is

3849
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:04,520
the Earth so Universe originated very

3850
03:19:04,520 --> 03:19:08,160
important data around 20 billions years

3851
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:11,160
back by a huge explosion now next is

3852
03:19:11,160 --> 03:19:14,199
Earth Earth Earth Milky Way galaxy may

3853
03:19:14,199 --> 03:19:18,120
we have is the earth 4.5 billions years

3854
03:19:18,120 --> 03:19:19,960
ago so with time when the explosion

3855
03:19:19,960 --> 03:19:21,960
happened the smaller smaller one they

3856
03:19:21,960 --> 03:19:24,199
joined together and the smaller means to

3857
03:19:24,199 --> 03:19:28,279
say uh uh the Earth the other stars the

3858
03:19:28,279 --> 03:19:30,479
galaxies they started organizing

3859
03:19:30,479 --> 03:19:32,760
themselves and if I talk about the Earth

3860
03:19:32,760 --> 03:19:34,800
Earth started forming in the

3861
03:19:34,800 --> 03:19:39,720
4.5 billions years ago right and if I

3862
03:19:39,720 --> 03:19:42,040
talk about the life this is the this

3863
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:44,920
this is the universe formed at 20

3864
03:19:44,920 --> 03:19:47,640
billions years ago this is a 4.5 and if

3865
03:19:47,640 --> 03:19:50,279
I talk about the life life is formed

3866
03:19:50,279 --> 03:19:55,880
around 500 Millions years ago

3867
03:19:55,880 --> 03:19:58,880
life the first Universe then Earth and

3868
03:19:58,880 --> 03:20:00,840
then we have is a life earlier

3869
03:20:00,840 --> 03:20:02,279
atmosphere let's look at the earlier

3870
03:20:02,279 --> 03:20:04,560
atmosphere all these are the lines from

3871
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:07,880
the uh ncrt only there was no atmosphere

3872
03:20:07,880 --> 03:20:10,399
on the early Earth water Vapors was

3873
03:20:10,399 --> 03:20:12,359
there temperature was really very high

3874
03:20:12,359 --> 03:20:14,120
and it is considered the temperature was

3875
03:20:14,120 --> 03:20:17,720
all around 800° C so whatever water was

3876
03:20:17,720 --> 03:20:19,239
there water was in the form of water

3877
03:20:19,239 --> 03:20:21,920
vapor methane was there carbon dioxide

3878
03:20:21,920 --> 03:20:24,359
was there NH3 was releasing from the

3879
03:20:24,359 --> 03:20:27,560
molten Mass cover the surface at that

3880
03:20:27,560 --> 03:20:29,520
time lot of volcanic activities was

3881
03:20:29,520 --> 03:20:32,359
there and because of the volcanic

3882
03:20:32,359 --> 03:20:35,080
activities Earth was covered with a

3883
03:20:35,080 --> 03:20:37,840
molten mass and that were releasing

3884
03:20:37,840 --> 03:20:39,960
these gases of carbon dioxide methane

3885
03:20:39,960 --> 03:20:41,960
ammonia and water vapor was was present

3886
03:20:41,960 --> 03:20:45,359
present UV rays as there was

3887
03:20:45,359 --> 03:20:48,680
no you know ozone was not there so as

3888
03:20:48,680 --> 03:20:51,080
ozone was not there UV ray from the Sun

3889
03:20:51,080 --> 03:20:52,920
broke up the water UV ray they were

3890
03:20:52,920 --> 03:20:55,439
directly coming from the uh you know

3891
03:20:55,439 --> 03:20:57,279
from the outside from the Sun directly

3892
03:20:57,279 --> 03:20:59,000
into the Earth surface due to which

3893
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,239
whatever water vapor was present they

3894
03:21:01,239 --> 03:21:05,600
were bro broken up into the H2 and O2 H2

3895
03:21:05,600 --> 03:21:09,720
H2 being lighter H2 will go up oxygen

3896
03:21:09,720 --> 03:21:12,920
now this oxygen combined with H3 it

3897
03:21:12,920 --> 03:21:16,000
combine with CH4 and it forms the water

3898
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:17,600
carbon dioxide

3899
03:21:17,600 --> 03:21:22,040
Etc so they form the water okay because

3900
03:21:22,040 --> 03:21:24,520
of this water because water Vapors was

3901
03:21:24,520 --> 03:21:25,920
there were there in the environment and

3902
03:21:25,920 --> 03:21:28,319
these water vapor they condens and that

3903
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:31,000
lead to the cloud formation so rain

3904
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:34,680
happened and Rain happened for years for

3905
03:21:34,680 --> 03:21:36,880
the millions of years rain happened and

3906
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:40,040
because of those you know the clouds and

3907
03:21:40,040 --> 03:21:41,920
because of that rain today we have is a

3908
03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:44,920
oceans today we have that sea with

3909
03:21:44,920 --> 03:21:48,960
us then the ozone layer started forming

3910
03:21:48,960 --> 03:21:51,399
right as it cooled the water vapor fell

3911
03:21:51,399 --> 03:21:54,960
as a rain to form the

3912
03:21:55,439 --> 03:21:58,960
oceans okay

3913
03:21:59,199 --> 03:22:01,680
clear no this is not Oparin and Harden

3914
03:22:01,680 --> 03:22:03,840
Theory unti this is just the origin of

3915
03:22:03,840 --> 03:22:05,840
life this is a just first second

3916
03:22:05,840 --> 03:22:09,080
paragraph of your ncrt we will go

3917
03:22:09,080 --> 03:22:12,160
towards the opin andalin also then there

3918
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:15,080
was an ozone formation then there was a

3919
03:22:15,080 --> 03:22:18,800
rainfall okay life appeared almost 500

3920
03:22:18,800 --> 03:22:21,199
Millions years ago written over here

3921
03:22:21,199 --> 03:22:24,520
also okay buddies clear so this was a

3922
03:22:24,520 --> 03:22:26,840
primitive atmosphere this was the

3923
03:22:26,840 --> 03:22:29,199
Primitive atmosphere now moving on to

3924
03:22:29,199 --> 03:22:30,960
the next is now we have to discuss the

3925
03:22:30,960 --> 03:22:33,199
origin of life that was origin of

3926
03:22:33,199 --> 03:22:35,319
universe now origin of life in the

3927
03:22:35,319 --> 03:22:37,680
origin of life we have various theories

3928
03:22:37,680 --> 03:22:40,040
the first theory is the theory of

3929
03:22:40,040 --> 03:22:42,960
special creation so special some special

3930
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:44,520
person came and special person they

3931
03:22:44,520 --> 03:22:46,600
formed the Earth and who is that special

3932
03:22:46,600 --> 03:22:48,880
person that is a God so this was given

3933
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:52,279
by the father Sor is he said God created

3934
03:22:52,279 --> 03:22:54,840
everyone on one day they created sand on

3935
03:22:54,840 --> 03:22:57,000
another day they created plants on

3936
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,800
another day they created Birds Etc now

3937
03:22:59,800 --> 03:23:02,600
Cosmos zoic Theory Cosmic theory is also

3938
03:23:02,600 --> 03:23:06,279
termed as panspermia

3939
03:23:06,760 --> 03:23:10,640
Theory panspermia Theory and this

3940
03:23:10,640 --> 03:23:14,040
panspermia Theory is given by RoR they

3941
03:23:14,040 --> 03:23:17,920
say that unit of life or Spore they were

3942
03:23:17,920 --> 03:23:20,000
transferred they were transferred or

3943
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,319
they came from any other planet

3944
03:23:22,319 --> 03:23:25,279
including Earth so they came from any

3945
03:23:25,279 --> 03:23:27,479
other planet so this was a theory given

3946
03:23:27,479 --> 03:23:30,600
in Cosmic proposed by RoR next is theory

3947
03:23:30,600 --> 03:23:32,600
of the spontaneous generation

3948
03:23:32,600 --> 03:23:36,199
spontaneous spontaneous means suddenly

3949
03:23:36,199 --> 03:23:39,439
life comes from the um you know

3950
03:23:39,439 --> 03:23:42,000
non-living substances is what they say

3951
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:44,720
autogenesis a biogenesis autogenesis

3952
03:23:44,720 --> 03:23:46,439
supported by the ancient Greek

3953
03:23:46,439 --> 03:23:49,680
philosopher tales and exender xenop

3954
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:53,720
Plateau edicol aristal Etc it state that

3955
03:23:53,720 --> 03:23:54,760
ignore this

3956
03:23:54,760 --> 03:23:58,800
line it state that life came of the

3957
03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:01,880
decaying rotting matter Like Straw mud

3958
03:24:01,880 --> 03:24:05,479
Etc clear so they said k n life does

3959
03:24:05,479 --> 03:24:08,600
life came from um you know the dead

3960
03:24:08,600 --> 03:24:10,840
substances this is what they said they

3961
03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:13,800
said they said it was a some wheat brand

3962
03:24:13,800 --> 03:24:16,560
was there so there was a huge wheat and

3963
03:24:16,560 --> 03:24:18,920
because wheat was there and because of

3964
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:20,840
that wheat the you know the rat

3965
03:24:20,840 --> 03:24:23,399
formation occur so this is how uh uh

3966
03:24:23,399 --> 03:24:24,760
like their Theory

3967
03:24:24,760 --> 03:24:27,199
came and today I know you all must be

3968
03:24:27,199 --> 03:24:29,160
laughing what is this story all about

3969
03:24:29,160 --> 03:24:32,279
but at that time we cannot go back to

3970
03:24:32,279 --> 03:24:34,120
the time machine they do not have any

3971
03:24:34,120 --> 03:24:35,720
idea regarding the natural selection

3972
03:24:35,720 --> 03:24:37,880
today we know about natural selection

3973
03:24:37,880 --> 03:24:41,080
today we have an idea of uh you know uh

3974
03:24:41,080 --> 03:24:44,560
different species the um you know the

3975
03:24:44,560 --> 03:24:46,960
effect of environment genes Etc at that

3976
03:24:46,960 --> 03:24:49,080
time they do not have any idea of Gene

3977
03:24:49,080 --> 03:24:51,800
genes were discovered later on and today

3978
03:24:51,800 --> 03:24:54,000
we know mosis the mitosis these things

3979
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:55,640
are there they didn't know about it so

3980
03:24:55,640 --> 03:24:57,760
they came up this idea okay that can be

3981
03:24:57,760 --> 03:24:59,680
one of the reason and S it is important

3982
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:01,680
also so whatever you

3983
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:04,640
think if you're thinking their thinking

3984
03:25:04,640 --> 03:25:07,720
was also important when when you come up

3985
03:25:07,720 --> 03:25:09,479
with an idea suppose they came up with

3986
03:25:09,479 --> 03:25:11,800
this idea that life came from mud life

3987
03:25:11,800 --> 03:25:13,960
came from you know a sweat t-shirt

3988
03:25:13,960 --> 03:25:18,239
sweaty t-shirt so that makes other

3989
03:25:18,239 --> 03:25:21,479
people realize ke is he right or wrong

3990
03:25:21,479 --> 03:25:23,640
then they start studying they start

3991
03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:26,479
going in that

3992
03:25:29,680 --> 03:25:31,319
direction

3993
03:25:31,319 --> 03:25:33,840
m' ma'am it would be been easier to

3994
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:35,520
study that we will study that also we

3995
03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:37,520
will study that also nothing wait now

3996
03:25:37,520 --> 03:25:40,080
next is Lis pasture Lis pasture

3997
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:42,720
demonstrated that life came only from

3998
03:25:42,720 --> 03:25:45,080
pre-existing life and disproved this

3999
03:25:45,080 --> 03:25:47,520
Theory the theory which was given by

4000
03:25:47,520 --> 03:25:49,439
given like spontaneous generation Auto

4001
03:25:49,439 --> 03:25:52,279
biogenesis this was disapproved by the

4002
03:25:52,279 --> 03:25:54,560
um you know the Luis paser not only the

4003
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:56,560
L Pasha there was one more scientist

4004
03:25:56,560 --> 03:25:58,720
whose name was Lazaro

4005
03:25:58,720 --> 03:26:01,520
Spen and Francisco ready so there were

4006
03:26:01,520 --> 03:26:03,680
three different scientists Luis pasture

4007
03:26:03,680 --> 03:26:06,800
Lazaro Spen and Francisco ready so they

4008
03:26:06,800 --> 03:26:08,880
did different kind of experiment and

4009
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:12,279
their ultimate motive was to realize

4010
03:26:12,279 --> 03:26:14,760
life came from pre-existing life life

4011
03:26:14,760 --> 03:26:17,880
doesn't come from a non-living thing so

4012
03:26:17,880 --> 03:26:20,040
this was their idea three scientists

4013
03:26:20,040 --> 03:26:22,120
they worked

4014
03:26:22,120 --> 03:26:23,760
differently

4015
03:26:23,760 --> 03:26:26,560
okay now moving on to the next modern

4016
03:26:26,560 --> 03:26:29,920
chemical theory of origin of Life modern

4017
03:26:29,920 --> 03:26:32,399
chemical theory of origin of life was

4018
03:26:32,399 --> 03:26:35,680
given by Oparin AI Oparin he was a

4019
03:26:35,680 --> 03:26:39,160
Russian scientist and halan Halden was a

4020
03:26:39,160 --> 03:26:42,000
England born Indian scientist operan

4021
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:44,880
theory was published in a book origin of

4022
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:48,359
life in 1938 very very very important

4023
03:26:48,359 --> 03:26:50,640
three marker may this question you can

4024
03:26:50,640 --> 03:26:53,239
easily

4025
03:26:53,239 --> 03:26:57,680
expect along with what along with the

4026
03:26:57,680 --> 03:27:00,800
experiment which we will do now okay now

4027
03:27:00,800 --> 03:27:04,399
they said ke life initially when life

4028
03:27:04,399 --> 03:27:06,680
came life came from non-living

4029
03:27:06,680 --> 03:27:09,920
substances then from non-living to

4030
03:27:09,920 --> 03:27:13,279
living this is what their uh statement

4031
03:27:13,279 --> 03:27:16,319
was now proposed by Oparin and halan

4032
03:27:16,319 --> 03:27:19,160
this states that life form from a life

4033
03:27:19,160 --> 03:27:23,279
was originated first first from a non

4034
03:27:23,279 --> 03:27:25,680
living inorganic organic molecules such

4035
03:27:25,680 --> 03:27:29,279
as CH4 NH3 water sugar proteins nuclic

4036
03:27:29,279 --> 03:27:32,640
acid Etc they gave this statement of a

4037
03:27:32,640 --> 03:27:36,479
biogenesis first but biogenesis later on

4038
03:27:36,479 --> 03:27:40,040
they said first life was formed from

4039
03:27:40,040 --> 03:27:42,760
non-living substance stances like

4040
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:45,399
inorganic substances organic substances

4041
03:27:45,399 --> 03:27:49,160
and from that life came from

4042
03:27:49,160 --> 03:27:52,680
life okay and everyone please stop

4043
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:56,800
talking what all you guys talk

4044
03:27:58,319 --> 03:28:02,319
about okay so let's

4045
03:28:02,319 --> 03:28:04,080
proceed

4046
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:07,760
okay H ch ch now let's

4047
03:28:07,760 --> 03:28:11,239
proceed experimental evidence of chem

4048
03:28:11,239 --> 03:28:13,239
chemical origin of Life chemical origin

4049
03:28:13,239 --> 03:28:15,800
of life was given by opin and Harden

4050
03:28:15,800 --> 03:28:18,239
Oparin was from Russia and Harden was

4051
03:28:18,239 --> 03:28:20,359
from England so they gave this idea of

4052
03:28:20,359 --> 03:28:22,920
chemical Evolution they said life first

4053
03:28:22,920 --> 03:28:25,279
came from in organic substances and then

4054
03:28:25,279 --> 03:28:29,160
from the life itself and now this is an

4055
03:28:29,160 --> 03:28:30,800
experimental evidence and this

4056
03:28:30,800 --> 03:28:32,800
experimental evidence was super

4057
03:28:32,800 --> 03:28:34,560
important again I'm saying for boards it

4058
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:36,239
is super important and if you really

4059
03:28:36,239 --> 03:28:37,920
think this chapter is difficult I'll say

4060
03:28:37,920 --> 03:28:39,600
no this chapter is not at all difficult

4061
03:28:39,600 --> 03:28:42,880
this is very easy

4062
03:28:42,880 --> 03:28:44,439
okay

4063
03:28:44,439 --> 03:28:47,239
now they created a condition like that

4064
03:28:47,239 --> 03:28:49,960
of a primitive Earth who did this first

4065
03:28:49,960 --> 03:28:52,880
of all first of

4066
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:56,520
all Miller and Ur experiment this was

4067
03:28:56,520 --> 03:29:00,359
the Miller and Ur

4068
03:29:02,080 --> 03:29:06,000
experiment and Ur Miller and Ur came

4069
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:09,319
forward and they said we will prove so

4070
03:29:09,319 --> 03:29:13,439
they gave the experiment proof

4071
03:29:13,439 --> 03:29:15,319
of

4072
03:29:15,319 --> 03:29:18,359
experimental proof

4073
03:29:18,359 --> 03:29:22,920
of chemical origin of

4074
03:29:25,760 --> 03:29:29,800
Life origin of

4075
03:29:29,800 --> 03:29:32,680
life right they did this experiment so

4076
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:34,960
let's have a look now what they did they

4077
03:29:34,960 --> 03:29:37,560
took two flask and they jointed in this

4078
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:40,560
way in the first flask was bigger and

4079
03:29:40,560 --> 03:29:43,279
another flask flask was smaller in the

4080
03:29:43,279 --> 03:29:46,199
first flask there was electrode which

4081
03:29:46,199 --> 03:29:48,880
were producing electrical discharge

4082
03:29:48,880 --> 03:29:51,600
because at the Primitive environment at

4083
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:53,160
that particular time there were

4084
03:29:53,160 --> 03:29:55,960
electrical discharges and because of

4085
03:29:55,960 --> 03:29:58,279
those electrical thundering

4086
03:29:58,279 --> 03:30:02,120
activities they also want y be same way

4087
03:30:02,120 --> 03:30:04,720
we have to create a same environment so

4088
03:30:04,720 --> 03:30:06,600
they did electrode they took electrode

4089
03:30:06,600 --> 03:30:09,800
also right they wanted over here the

4090
03:30:09,800 --> 03:30:13,080
temperature should be ra very high and

4091
03:30:13,080 --> 03:30:14,960
how did they create that temperature

4092
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:17,359
because they took another flask and in

4093
03:30:17,359 --> 03:30:19,520
another flask they were boiling the

4094
03:30:19,520 --> 03:30:22,080
water as the boiling the water the

4095
03:30:22,080 --> 03:30:23,960
vapors they were coming here which were

4096
03:30:23,960 --> 03:30:26,080
maintaining the temperature of almost

4097
03:30:26,080 --> 03:30:27,359
around

4098
03:30:27,359 --> 03:30:31,439
800° C which itself is huge just imagine

4099
03:30:31,439 --> 03:30:33,359
Deli temperature if it goes more than

4100
03:30:33,359 --> 03:30:38,560
50° C we burn like hell and it is 800°

4101
03:30:38,560 --> 03:30:41,359
C right temperature was really high

4102
03:30:41,359 --> 03:30:43,279
because of this boiling water at that

4103
03:30:43,279 --> 03:30:45,120
particular environment environment at

4104
03:30:45,120 --> 03:30:46,800
that particular time environment was

4105
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:49,520
reducing reducing means no oxygen was

4106
03:30:49,520 --> 03:30:52,520
there so here reducing

4107
03:30:52,520 --> 03:30:54,840
environment how did they create reducing

4108
03:30:54,840 --> 03:30:56,840
environment they created reducing

4109
03:30:56,840 --> 03:31:00,080
environment by the vacuum pump so they

4110
03:31:00,080 --> 03:31:03,560
took this vacuum pump and they used it

4111
03:31:03,560 --> 03:31:05,439
here and with this they were producing

4112
03:31:05,439 --> 03:31:08,640
the and reducing environment no

4113
03:31:08,640 --> 03:31:12,000
oxygen so everything in this uh chamber

4114
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:15,479
was like that of a previous uh thing now

4115
03:31:15,479 --> 03:31:18,399
they introduced some gases also methane

4116
03:31:18,399 --> 03:31:21,160
ammonia water that in the form of this

4117
03:31:21,160 --> 03:31:24,720
moisture and H2 was there it was in the

4118
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:28,359
ratio of 1 is 2 is to 1 where one was

4119
03:31:28,359 --> 03:31:30,760
your

4120
03:31:32,120 --> 03:31:35,120
ammonia

4121
03:31:35,560 --> 03:31:40,479
sorry clear they kept this setup as such

4122
03:31:40,479 --> 03:31:43,600
with a G gases inside with electrode

4123
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:46,279
with temperature very high and they kept

4124
03:31:46,279 --> 03:31:48,040
this for 7

4125
03:31:48,040 --> 03:31:50,359
days then they came into that room

4126
03:31:50,359 --> 03:31:53,840
Miller and uray and they what they did

4127
03:31:53,840 --> 03:31:56,520
they condensed whatever substances they

4128
03:31:56,520 --> 03:31:58,199
were forming over here they wanted to

4129
03:31:58,199 --> 03:32:00,040
condense and they wanted to check what

4130
03:32:00,040 --> 03:32:02,760
all things are there in it what all

4131
03:32:02,760 --> 03:32:05,680
reaction happened because of these gases

4132
03:32:05,680 --> 03:32:08,359
so they used one condenser from that

4133
03:32:08,359 --> 03:32:11,199
condenser water was coming in and water

4134
03:32:11,199 --> 03:32:14,199
was going out water was not in touch

4135
03:32:14,199 --> 03:32:16,000
with the gases water was not in touch

4136
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:17,720
with the substances which were making

4137
03:32:17,720 --> 03:32:20,479
over here it just that some a pipe is

4138
03:32:20,479 --> 03:32:23,680
here and outside some water is Flowing

4139
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:27,560
just to cool down because 800° C if

4140
03:32:27,560 --> 03:32:29,120
something is there it's very difficult

4141
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:31,520
to touch isn't it then they collect it

4142
03:32:31,520 --> 03:32:33,359
here with the help of a to and they

4143
03:32:33,359 --> 03:32:35,640
realized organic substances are there

4144
03:32:35,640 --> 03:32:37,960
but all organic substances they found

4145
03:32:37,960 --> 03:32:40,040
nucleotides were there some amino acids

4146
03:32:40,040 --> 03:32:42,560
were there so they were shocked how this

4147
03:32:42,560 --> 03:32:45,560
formation occur so they realized these

4148
03:32:45,560 --> 03:32:48,640
formation was because of the gases which

4149
03:32:48,640 --> 03:32:51,399
were prevailing at that time they were

4150
03:32:51,399 --> 03:32:53,600
because of the electrode they were

4151
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:55,199
because of the temperature at that

4152
03:32:55,199 --> 03:32:56,439
particular

4153
03:32:56,439 --> 03:32:59,640
time is this point clear so again I'm

4154
03:32:59,640 --> 03:33:02,720
saying everyone you all have your notes

4155
03:33:02,720 --> 03:33:06,120
make this diagram super important again

4156
03:33:06,120 --> 03:33:08,120
up though I am standing here and this

4157
03:33:08,120 --> 03:33:12,760
can be asked in your paper okay

4158
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:15,760
okay let's

4159
03:33:15,760 --> 03:33:19,520
start now let's read let's do a quick

4160
03:33:19,520 --> 03:33:22,560
reading now they made electrod discharge

4161
03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:26,880
a closed flask CH4 NH3 water water vapor

4162
03:33:26,880 --> 03:33:28,760
as a result some amino acid formation

4163
03:33:28,760 --> 03:33:31,160
was there this was asked in neat paper

4164
03:33:31,160 --> 03:33:32,800
though it is there in your cbsc uh in

4165
03:33:32,800 --> 03:33:35,279
your ncrt also so can be asked similar

4166
03:33:35,279 --> 03:33:36,960
experiment other observed the formation

4167
03:33:36,960 --> 03:33:38,760
of sugar nitrogen on basis pigments and

4168
03:33:38,760 --> 03:33:40,760
fat other scientists also did did this

4169
03:33:40,760 --> 03:33:42,439
this experiment they said okay if he

4170
03:33:42,439 --> 03:33:44,120
he's doing this experiment this is very

4171
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:46,199
easy to set up let's do this

4172
03:33:46,199 --> 03:33:48,720
also their name was not there because

4173
03:33:48,720 --> 03:33:50,680
Miller and Ur they were Pioneer in this

4174
03:33:50,680 --> 03:33:52,520
and that is the reason we study their

4175
03:33:52,520 --> 03:33:55,120
name in our

4176
03:33:55,439 --> 03:33:58,880
textbook okay now first non- cellular

4177
03:33:58,880 --> 03:34:01,399
form of life originated three billions

4178
03:34:01,399 --> 03:34:03,080
years ago while RNA protein

4179
03:34:03,080 --> 03:34:06,720
polysaccharides Etc so life came

4180
03:34:06,720 --> 03:34:11,560
here okay now moving on to the next now

4181
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:13,720
we have to move towards the evidence of

4182
03:34:13,720 --> 03:34:16,439
organic evolution now it is like we

4183
03:34:16,439 --> 03:34:18,279
cannot go back to that time can we go

4184
03:34:18,279 --> 03:34:20,520
back to that time not possible so we

4185
03:34:20,520 --> 03:34:22,880
looked for some evidences so these

4186
03:34:22,880 --> 03:34:24,760
evidences they were paleontological

4187
03:34:24,760 --> 03:34:27,080
evidences comparative Anatomy morphology

4188
03:34:27,080 --> 03:34:28,840
physiological biochemistry biog

4189
03:34:28,840 --> 03:34:31,279
geographical and embryological evidences

4190
03:34:31,279 --> 03:34:33,840
by looking at these evidences by

4191
03:34:33,840 --> 03:34:36,680
studying these evidences see now what we

4192
03:34:36,680 --> 03:34:39,680
have is inorganic substances organic

4193
03:34:39,680 --> 03:34:43,520
substances with time we realize ke the

4194
03:34:43,520 --> 03:34:45,319
number of species which exist today they

4195
03:34:45,319 --> 03:34:46,399
were not

4196
03:34:46,399 --> 03:34:49,040
same so we wanted to study what all

4197
03:34:49,040 --> 03:34:52,000
species were there in those million 500

4198
03:34:52,000 --> 03:34:55,000
millions of years back how this

4199
03:34:55,000 --> 03:34:57,199
Evolution happened so we started

4200
03:34:57,199 --> 03:34:59,880
studying the

4201
03:35:00,279 --> 03:35:04,880
evidences okay clear let's have a look

4202
03:35:04,880 --> 03:35:08,040
first paleontological evidences right

4203
03:35:08,040 --> 03:35:09,720
paleontological evidences now

4204
03:35:09,720 --> 03:35:12,319
paleontological EV es that means study

4205
03:35:12,319 --> 03:35:14,760
of

4206
03:35:15,080 --> 03:35:20,359
fossils that means study of

4207
03:35:21,560 --> 03:35:25,239
fossiles right to study why this is used

4208
03:35:25,239 --> 03:35:28,319
to study the evolutionary history or the

4209
03:35:28,319 --> 03:35:30,880
race history because you know early now

4210
03:35:30,880 --> 03:35:34,040
we have a horse a modern horse and if

4211
03:35:34,040 --> 03:35:36,439
you study the evolution of horse you

4212
03:35:36,439 --> 03:35:40,319
will realize horse was like the size of

4213
03:35:40,319 --> 03:35:42,800
a box with time it developed and today

4214
03:35:42,800 --> 03:35:45,920
we have is a modern horse with us how

4215
03:35:45,920 --> 03:35:48,040
with the help of a penological evidences

4216
03:35:48,040 --> 03:35:50,319
because we looked at the

4217
03:35:50,319 --> 03:35:53,040
fossils and fossils they were present in

4218
03:35:53,040 --> 03:35:56,080
sedimentary rocks by determining the age

4219
03:35:56,080 --> 03:35:59,080
of the sedimentary rocks we got to know

4220
03:35:59,080 --> 03:36:01,720
that this particular kind of horse used

4221
03:36:01,720 --> 03:36:04,800
to exist at that particular time and now

4222
03:36:04,800 --> 03:36:07,439
we have is a

4223
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:12,279
this right now next one to study the

4224
03:36:12,279 --> 03:36:14,000
connecting link between the two group of

4225
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:16,520
organism to study about the extinct

4226
03:36:16,520 --> 03:36:18,640
animals to study about the geological

4227
03:36:18,640 --> 03:36:21,000
period by analysing the fossils in

4228
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:23,680
different sedimentary rocks two studies

4229
03:36:23,680 --> 03:36:26,080
showed that life forms varied over time

4230
03:36:26,080 --> 03:36:28,800
and certain life forms are restricted to

4231
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:32,560
certain geological time spans these are

4232
03:36:32,560 --> 03:36:35,880
the paleontological

4233
03:36:35,880 --> 03:36:42,479
evidences right clear one second

4234
03:36:47,399 --> 03:36:51,520
okay now moving on to the next is this

4235
03:36:51,520 --> 03:36:53,600
comparative Anatomy seven second

4236
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:56,880
evidence we have is comparative anatomy

4237
03:36:56,880 --> 03:36:59,560
and the morphology now listen what kind

4238
03:36:59,560 --> 03:37:01,479
of question comes can come can be asked

4239
03:37:01,479 --> 03:37:04,199
in the paper he uh write down the

4240
03:37:04,199 --> 03:37:05,800
evidences of evolution so first

4241
03:37:05,800 --> 03:37:07,760
penological evidences everything I have

4242
03:37:07,760 --> 03:37:09,600
given you now second we are studying

4243
03:37:09,600 --> 03:37:13,520
this no no we are not uh looking at it

4244
03:37:13,520 --> 03:37:14,880
right or

4245
03:37:14,880 --> 03:37:20,040
nothing now homology homo homo homo

4246
03:37:20,040 --> 03:37:23,960
means same or

4247
03:37:23,960 --> 03:37:27,120
similar what

4248
03:37:27,120 --> 03:37:31,000
origin origin is similar origin is

4249
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:35,960
similar but function is

4250
03:37:36,040 --> 03:37:39,399
different function is

4251
03:37:39,399 --> 03:37:42,399
different

4252
03:37:43,359 --> 03:37:45,840
function is different now how will you

4253
03:37:45,840 --> 03:37:48,479
understand this let's take my example

4254
03:37:48,479 --> 03:37:51,720
now it is like it is

4255
03:37:51,720 --> 03:37:55,880
like I have a family right in my family

4256
03:37:55,880 --> 03:37:57,880
there are five

4257
03:37:57,880 --> 03:38:00,680
members one is doing one function means

4258
03:38:00,680 --> 03:38:03,359
someone is a teacher someone is an IT

4259
03:38:03,359 --> 03:38:05,080
professional someone is something

4260
03:38:05,080 --> 03:38:06,520
someone is something someone is

4261
03:38:06,520 --> 03:38:08,760
something but we have a common origin

4262
03:38:08,760 --> 03:38:11,000
this is termed as homolog

4263
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:13,920
similarity based on the common origin if

4264
03:38:13,920 --> 03:38:16,520
we have a common Orin if we have a

4265
03:38:16,520 --> 03:38:20,040
common ancestor if we have a common

4266
03:38:20,040 --> 03:38:23,359
ancestor and similar basic plan of

4267
03:38:23,359 --> 03:38:25,920
organization embryonic development is

4268
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:27,760
similar that is

4269
03:38:27,760 --> 03:38:32,040
homoy homo similarity loogy means to say

4270
03:38:32,040 --> 03:38:35,520
in the terms of origin orientation

4271
03:38:35,520 --> 03:38:38,120
organization embryonic development if

4272
03:38:38,120 --> 03:38:42,560
everything is same but function is not

4273
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:44,560
same this is

4274
03:38:44,560 --> 03:38:48,479
homology homology gives us an idea of a

4275
03:38:48,479 --> 03:38:51,840
divergent evolution so it gives an idea

4276
03:38:51,840 --> 03:38:55,600
of divergent

4277
03:39:02,399 --> 03:39:06,000
evolution divergent evolution because

4278
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:08,960
something is diverging from a

4279
03:39:08,960 --> 03:39:12,239
point d

4280
03:39:12,640 --> 03:39:16,199
vergent right okay so here for this

4281
03:39:16,199 --> 03:39:18,199
respect we have an

4282
03:39:18,199 --> 03:39:21,239
example we have a Thorns of bong Andia

4283
03:39:21,239 --> 03:39:23,600
we have a tendrils of

4284
03:39:23,600 --> 03:39:27,080
kukura both of them they have a common

4285
03:39:27,080 --> 03:39:29,760
origin epical meristem right they have a

4286
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:31,760
common origin but they have a different

4287
03:39:31,760 --> 03:39:34,040
function Thorn's function is a

4288
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:35,960
protection tenderers they help in

4289
03:39:35,960 --> 03:39:38,560
providing the support and you know bi

4290
03:39:38,560 --> 03:39:41,040
boty more than me now you know this the

4291
03:39:41,040 --> 03:39:43,279
thorns and the bong Thorns of the bongan

4292
03:39:43,279 --> 03:39:46,040
Valia and the tendril of kukur tendrils

4293
03:39:46,040 --> 03:39:49,080
helps in climbing it provides the

4294
03:39:49,080 --> 03:39:51,920
support isn't it now moving on to the

4295
03:39:51,920 --> 03:39:53,800
next is if you'll take all of this what

4296
03:39:53,800 --> 03:39:55,720
is the similarity between these there's

4297
03:39:55,720 --> 03:39:58,040
a man cheetah Veil and the bat what is

4298
03:39:58,040 --> 03:39:59,520
the similarity between these come on

4299
03:39:59,520 --> 03:40:01,520
tell me in the comment section come on

4300
03:40:01,520 --> 03:40:03,040
come on tell me in the comment section

4301
03:40:03,040 --> 03:40:04,640
what is the similarity between these

4302
03:40:04,640 --> 03:40:06,880
these

4303
03:40:09,160 --> 03:40:13,239
all come on come on come

4304
03:40:16,600 --> 03:40:19,760
on come on similarity what's the

4305
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:22,680
similarity similarity is all of them

4306
03:40:22,680 --> 03:40:26,040
they are mammals they have a common

4307
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:30,160
origin yes butterfly

4308
03:40:30,160 --> 03:40:33,920
butterfly yes

4309
03:40:33,920 --> 03:40:36,040
they

4310
03:40:36,040 --> 03:40:40,359
huh yes tendrils mammals yes just me

4311
03:40:40,359 --> 03:40:41,479
you're

4312
03:40:41,479 --> 03:40:45,279
right okay so here if you look at their

4313
03:40:45,279 --> 03:40:47,439
four limbs if you look at their four

4314
03:40:47,439 --> 03:40:50,800
limbs the for liim structure is same see

4315
03:40:50,800 --> 03:40:52,399
there will be see what is this bone

4316
03:40:52,399 --> 03:40:55,319
humorus radius alna there will be carpal

4317
03:40:55,319 --> 03:40:57,520
metacarpal everything is same humorous

4318
03:40:57,520 --> 03:40:59,760
radius ala humorous radius ala humorous

4319
03:40:59,760 --> 03:41:02,760
radius those structure is different but

4320
03:41:02,760 --> 03:41:05,319
but overall if I say everything is same

4321
03:41:05,319 --> 03:41:07,319
they have a radius they have radius alna

4322
03:41:07,319 --> 03:41:09,279
humorus everything is same but the

4323
03:41:09,279 --> 03:41:11,120
function is different humans May what is

4324
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:14,080
the use for holding right what's the use

4325
03:41:14,080 --> 03:41:16,760
for cheah for running for the wheel

4326
03:41:16,760 --> 03:41:20,680
swimming for the bat climbing you know

4327
03:41:20,680 --> 03:41:23,000
to

4328
03:41:23,159 --> 03:41:26,439
support yes we all are same we belong to

4329
03:41:26,439 --> 03:41:29,080
each other isn't

4330
03:41:29,080 --> 03:41:34,199
it great we are family right so yes

4331
03:41:34,199 --> 03:41:38,479
absolutely right so they have a same

4332
03:41:39,040 --> 03:41:41,640
structure

4333
03:41:41,640 --> 03:41:45,159
but different

4334
03:41:47,159 --> 03:41:51,479
function different

4335
03:41:54,040 --> 03:41:56,640
function okay

4336
03:41:56,640 --> 03:42:00,920
now let's move on to the next

4337
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:07,680
analogy now analogy what is analogy

4338
03:42:07,680 --> 03:42:11,239
analogy means the or origin everything

4339
03:42:11,239 --> 03:42:13,399
is different

4340
03:42:13,399 --> 03:42:16,920
so origin they do not have any origin

4341
03:42:16,920 --> 03:42:19,800
origin is

4342
03:42:19,800 --> 03:42:22,800
different

4343
03:42:22,920 --> 03:42:27,680
but but function is

4344
03:42:29,960 --> 03:42:32,199
same is

4345
03:42:32,199 --> 03:42:34,880
same now let's have a look it is a

4346
03:42:34,880 --> 03:42:37,000
similarity in organ based on the similar

4347
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:39,960
function similar function right or

4348
03:42:39,960 --> 03:42:42,520
organs which have different origin and

4349
03:42:42,520 --> 03:42:45,520
dissimilar fundamental structure but

4350
03:42:45,520 --> 03:42:47,239
have a similar function or termed as

4351
03:42:47,239 --> 03:42:51,399
analogous organ are you guys sleeping no

4352
03:42:51,399 --> 03:42:54,760
right yes now moving on to the next is

4353
03:42:54,760 --> 03:42:57,120
examples up they look at this eyes of

4354
03:42:57,120 --> 03:43:00,600
octopus and mammal Sky look at the eyes

4355
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:03,760
what is the function to see the object

4356
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:05,720
but the structure is

4357
03:43:05,720 --> 03:43:09,359
different flippers next is flippers of

4358
03:43:09,359 --> 03:43:11,560
penguin and

4359
03:43:11,560 --> 03:43:14,239
dolphins origin is not same function is

4360
03:43:14,239 --> 03:43:18,760
same next is sweet potato and potato

4361
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:20,800
sweet potato is a root modification

4362
03:43:20,800 --> 03:43:23,040
whereas a potato is a stem

4363
03:43:23,040 --> 03:43:25,840
modification function is same food

4364
03:43:25,840 --> 03:43:28,199
storage function is same that is a food

4365
03:43:28,199 --> 03:43:29,560
storage isn't

4366
03:43:29,560 --> 03:43:34,159
it okay now let's move on to the

4367
03:43:34,159 --> 03:43:36,279
biochemical evidences so we have some

4368
03:43:36,279 --> 03:43:38,800
biochemical evidences also like organism

4369
03:43:38,800 --> 03:43:41,080
show similar in protein genes other

4370
03:43:41,080 --> 03:43:44,040
biomolecules metabolism it indicate a

4371
03:43:44,040 --> 03:43:48,439
common ancestry we look at the organism

4372
03:43:48,439 --> 03:43:50,640
we look at their biomolecules we look at

4373
03:43:50,640 --> 03:43:53,600
the atile coenzyme we look look look at

4374
03:43:53,600 --> 03:43:55,920
different things and we realize yes

4375
03:43:55,920 --> 03:43:58,960
genes are same yes these biochemicals

4376
03:43:58,960 --> 03:44:00,720
are same same enzyme which is

4377
03:44:00,720 --> 03:44:02,239
functioning in me same enzyme

4378
03:44:02,239 --> 03:44:04,760
functioning in any other animal this

4379
03:44:04,760 --> 03:44:07,600
gives us an idea that we have a common

4380
03:44:07,600 --> 03:44:10,199
ancestry we have not sorry we have a

4381
03:44:10,199 --> 03:44:11,600
kind of

4382
03:44:11,600 --> 03:44:13,199
relation

4383
03:44:13,199 --> 03:44:16,199
okay

4384
03:44:18,640 --> 03:44:21,080
okay let's move on to the next one

4385
03:44:21,080 --> 03:44:23,399
embryological evidences embryological

4386
03:44:23,399 --> 03:44:26,439
evidences was given by Ernest Heckle

4387
03:44:26,439 --> 03:44:28,439
right just let's complete this chapter

4388
03:44:28,439 --> 03:44:30,359
then I'll give you a break okay I'll

4389
03:44:30,359 --> 03:44:32,080
give you a

4390
03:44:32,080 --> 03:44:35,279
break it is observed that all vertebrate

4391
03:44:35,279 --> 03:44:37,279
embryos have some common features that

4392
03:44:37,279 --> 03:44:39,720
are absent in adult some common features

4393
03:44:39,720 --> 03:44:42,399
features are there which are absent in

4394
03:44:42,399 --> 03:44:45,120
adults all artivate embryo including

4395
03:44:45,120 --> 03:44:48,000
human develop vestigial gilets we used

4396
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:50,640
to have vestigial gillet just behind the

4397
03:44:50,640 --> 03:44:53,279
head but it is functional only in fishes

4398
03:44:53,279 --> 03:44:56,520
not found in any other individual so I

4399
03:44:56,520 --> 03:44:59,279
I'll show you do I have that image no I

4400
03:44:59,279 --> 03:45:01,239
don't have that image but if you'll

4401
03:45:01,239 --> 03:45:03,600
Google if you look at the embryos the

4402
03:45:03,600 --> 03:45:05,279
different embryos you will realize they

4403
03:45:05,279 --> 03:45:08,359
look alike either you take a fish one or

4404
03:45:08,359 --> 03:45:10,439
frog one all embryos they look alike

4405
03:45:10,439 --> 03:45:12,159
they will be having gill

4406
03:45:12,159 --> 03:45:16,120
slits are they functional in us no right

4407
03:45:16,120 --> 03:45:19,800
you remember Animal Kingdom in class

4408
03:45:20,520 --> 03:45:24,520
11th you remember class 11th may we used

4409
03:45:24,520 --> 03:45:27,199
to study uh key fenal gill slits are

4410
03:45:27,199 --> 03:45:29,159
their characteristic feature of cordate

4411
03:45:29,159 --> 03:45:31,359
so those fenal Gill slit they were

4412
03:45:31,359 --> 03:45:32,720
functional only in

4413
03:45:32,720 --> 03:45:35,279
fishes do we respire through gills no

4414
03:45:35,279 --> 03:45:38,560
right no however Carl alest one beer

4415
03:45:38,560 --> 03:45:40,600
rejected this proposal he noted that

4416
03:45:40,600 --> 03:45:42,319
embryos never pass through the adult

4417
03:45:42,319 --> 03:45:44,359
stage of any other animal it is just

4418
03:45:44,359 --> 03:45:47,279
their development stage so embryological

4419
03:45:47,279 --> 03:45:51,720
evidence was was given by Ernest Heckle

4420
03:45:51,720 --> 03:45:54,560
it was rejected by Van beer very very

4421
03:45:54,560 --> 03:45:59,960
very important question rejected by one

4422
03:45:59,960 --> 03:46:02,680
beer

4423
03:46:02,680 --> 03:46:06,880
11th Co now let's talk about evidences

4424
03:46:06,880 --> 03:46:11,600
from the biog geography

4425
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:19,000
evidences

4426
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:21,840
from

4427
03:46:21,840 --> 03:46:24,840
bio

4428
03:46:26,279 --> 03:46:29,920
geography evidences from biog

4429
03:46:29,920 --> 03:46:31,720
geography

4430
03:46:31,720 --> 03:46:35,359
right Darwin went to galpagos

4431
03:46:35,359 --> 03:46:37,479
Island what do you want me to repeat

4432
03:46:37,479 --> 03:46:41,600
butterfly I'll repeat that again

4433
03:46:42,120 --> 03:46:44,560
yes tell

4434
03:46:46,239 --> 03:46:49,159
me tell me tell

4435
03:46:49,159 --> 03:46:52,120
me tell me what do you want me to repeat

4436
03:46:52,120 --> 03:46:55,880
butterfly first what tell me what's your

4437
03:47:01,880 --> 03:47:03,439
name

4438
03:47:03,439 --> 03:47:07,359
okay tell me tell me tell me hey bhagan

4439
03:47:07,359 --> 03:47:10,120
what you all guys talk you you guys can

4440
03:47:10,120 --> 03:47:11,319
talk for

4441
03:47:11,319 --> 03:47:14,159
hours and you know it's your paper in a

4442
03:47:14,159 --> 03:47:17,840
few days you have your paper biology if

4443
03:47:17,840 --> 03:47:19,560
you're not studying then please let

4444
03:47:19,560 --> 03:47:22,279
other students study okay otherwise you

4445
03:47:22,279 --> 03:47:25,040
can please move

4446
03:47:31,800 --> 03:47:35,720
out okay any

4447
03:47:35,720 --> 03:47:40,399
doubt okay okay now adaptive radiation

4448
03:47:40,399 --> 03:47:42,840
so let's start this adaptive radiation

4449
03:47:42,840 --> 03:47:44,199
now first let's talk about the

4450
03:47:44,199 --> 03:47:46,319
biogeography I'll give you one thing and

4451
03:47:46,319 --> 03:47:49,279
then we will start writing something now

4452
03:47:49,279 --> 03:47:51,960
if I talk about the Darin Darin went to

4453
03:47:51,960 --> 03:47:54,960
Galapagos Island Galapagos Island is a

4454
03:47:54,960 --> 03:47:58,040
secluded um Island he went there he

4455
03:47:58,040 --> 03:48:01,960
realized ke U some birds are there which

4456
03:48:01,960 --> 03:48:04,920
are origin originally seed

4457
03:48:04,920 --> 03:48:07,520
eating then he realized some other birds

4458
03:48:07,520 --> 03:48:08,800
are also there which are very much

4459
03:48:08,800 --> 03:48:11,520
similar to seed eating wobblers but they

4460
03:48:11,520 --> 03:48:15,439
are adapted to various food some are

4461
03:48:15,439 --> 03:48:17,239
insect eating some are you know

4462
03:48:17,239 --> 03:48:20,359
vegetarian various adaptation was seen

4463
03:48:20,359 --> 03:48:22,479
so he said it is because of the

4464
03:48:22,479 --> 03:48:24,960
different environmental condition so he

4465
03:48:24,960 --> 03:48:27,800
called this as adaptive radiation so it

4466
03:48:27,800 --> 03:48:29,920
is like Original Seed eting birds were

4467
03:48:29,920 --> 03:48:32,239
there and Original Seed eting Birds they

4468
03:48:32,239 --> 03:48:34,680
were adapted to different environmental

4469
03:48:34,680 --> 03:48:37,279
condition some became you know insect

4470
03:48:37,279 --> 03:48:39,880
eating some became Cactus eating so like

4471
03:48:39,880 --> 03:48:42,640
this they were evolved so this he called

4472
03:48:42,640 --> 03:48:46,239
it as adaptive radiation right now this

4473
03:48:46,239 --> 03:48:48,159
is a process of evolution of different

4474
03:48:48,159 --> 03:48:51,080
species in a given geographical

4475
03:48:51,080 --> 03:48:54,520
area what is

4476
03:48:55,239 --> 03:49:01,159
this adaptive radiation is the process

4477
03:49:01,159 --> 03:49:04,159
of

4478
03:49:05,439 --> 03:49:08,040
evolution in

4479
03:49:08,040 --> 03:49:12,680
a given one geographical

4480
03:49:13,159 --> 03:49:16,159
area

4481
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:19,600
graphical

4482
03:49:19,600 --> 03:49:22,600
area

4483
03:49:23,439 --> 03:49:27,120
radiating from a

4484
03:49:30,159 --> 03:49:33,520
point is

4485
03:49:33,520 --> 03:49:37,600
called adaptive

4486
03:49:38,319 --> 03:49:40,120
radiation

4487
03:49:40,120 --> 03:49:44,000
is called adaptive

4488
03:49:44,439 --> 03:49:47,319
radiation right in a geographical area

4489
03:49:47,319 --> 03:49:49,359
if they radiate into different direction

4490
03:49:49,359 --> 03:49:51,960
that is the adaptive radiation right so

4491
03:49:51,960 --> 03:49:54,560
this was one of the

4492
03:49:54,560 --> 03:49:57,560
evidence similar kind of trend was seen

4493
03:49:57,560 --> 03:50:00,000
in Australia that is a marsupial

4494
03:50:00,000 --> 03:50:02,399
radiation all the marsupial they belong

4495
03:50:02,399 --> 03:50:06,800
to a same category right right so some

4496
03:50:06,800 --> 03:50:10,080
became Tasmanian wall tiger cat band

4497
03:50:10,080 --> 03:50:12,479
Bandit an maril right so this kind of

4498
03:50:12,479 --> 03:50:14,479
evolution was also

4499
03:50:14,479 --> 03:50:17,279
seen so this gives us an idea of what

4500
03:50:17,279 --> 03:50:19,000
does it gives us an idea it gives us an

4501
03:50:19,000 --> 03:50:21,439
idea of divergent evolution isn't it

4502
03:50:21,439 --> 03:50:23,040
it's a divergent evolution radiating

4503
03:50:23,040 --> 03:50:25,000
from the point I'll explain you one more

4504
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:28,520
thing wait similar Trend was seen in the

4505
03:50:28,520 --> 03:50:31,359
placental mammals Also earlier it was

4506
03:50:31,359 --> 03:50:33,319
the marsupial now I'm seeing the

4507
03:50:33,319 --> 03:50:36,560
placental mammals so in a geographical

4508
03:50:36,560 --> 03:50:39,800
area that is Australia there were

4509
03:50:39,800 --> 03:50:42,239
marsupial radiation

4510
03:50:42,239 --> 03:50:44,319
also

4511
03:50:44,319 --> 03:50:47,279
marsupial

4512
03:50:47,279 --> 03:50:51,000
radiation maral they were Evol evolving

4513
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:52,600
like

4514
03:50:52,600 --> 03:50:55,199
this your kangaroo

4515
03:50:55,199 --> 03:50:57,760
one right they were evolving they

4516
03:50:57,760 --> 03:51:01,159
realized in the same area the placental

4517
03:51:01,159 --> 03:51:04,720
mammals they were also

4518
03:51:04,720 --> 03:51:08,120
radiating same area similar Trend was

4519
03:51:08,120 --> 03:51:10,199
observed similar

4520
03:51:10,199 --> 03:51:13,239
Trend this is termed as convergent

4521
03:51:13,239 --> 03:51:15,040
evolution or the parallel

4522
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:18,439
Evolution right placental mammal in

4523
03:51:18,439 --> 03:51:20,760
Australia also exhibit adaptive

4524
03:51:20,760 --> 03:51:22,880
radiation in evolving into varieties of

4525
03:51:22,880 --> 03:51:25,640
such placental mammals which Each of

4526
03:51:25,640 --> 03:51:27,359
which appears to be similar to a

4527
03:51:27,359 --> 03:51:31,279
corresponding marial so in an area in a

4528
03:51:31,279 --> 03:51:33,640
particular geographical area there was a

4529
03:51:33,640 --> 03:51:35,920
convergent evolution what is that see if

4530
03:51:35,920 --> 03:51:38,239
I talk about only this what is this this

4531
03:51:38,239 --> 03:51:40,239
is a Divergent Evolution some Divergence

4532
03:51:40,239 --> 03:51:42,760
is happening but when I'm seeing in a

4533
03:51:42,760 --> 03:51:45,000
area in an area this evolution is also

4534
03:51:45,000 --> 03:51:46,880
happening and this is also happening and

4535
03:51:46,880 --> 03:51:48,319
they are very much similar to each other

4536
03:51:48,319 --> 03:51:50,199
see placental mammal if you look at the

4537
03:51:50,199 --> 03:51:51,960
mole they're very much similar to

4538
03:51:51,960 --> 03:51:54,720
marsupial mole placental May in the same

4539
03:51:54,720 --> 03:51:56,279
area if you look at the antier they're

4540
03:51:56,279 --> 03:51:58,279
very similar to the numbet if you look

4541
03:51:58,279 --> 03:52:01,800
at the this placental mouse marup mouse

4542
03:52:01,800 --> 03:52:04,960
lemmer spotted ccus flying squirrel

4543
03:52:04,960 --> 03:52:08,159
finger Bobcat Tasmanian diger cat wolf

4544
03:52:08,159 --> 03:52:10,840
Tasmanian wolf so this is termed as

4545
03:52:10,840 --> 03:52:13,560
convergent evolution in an area two

4546
03:52:13,560 --> 03:52:15,080
different things are happening and that

4547
03:52:15,080 --> 03:52:17,680
too similar to each other clear so this

4548
03:52:17,680 --> 03:52:19,319
also gives us an idea yes they were

4549
03:52:19,319 --> 03:52:20,680
similar to each other because they were

4550
03:52:20,680 --> 03:52:22,040
exposed to different environmental

4551
03:52:22,040 --> 03:52:25,680
condition so we can keep them under the

4552
03:52:25,680 --> 03:52:27,399
same category so that means kind of

4553
03:52:27,399 --> 03:52:29,760
relation is

4554
03:52:29,760 --> 03:52:32,760
there

4555
03:52:34,080 --> 03:52:35,640
okay

4556
03:52:35,640 --> 03:52:38,239
okay now moving on to the next we have

4557
03:52:38,239 --> 03:52:42,040
is evidence of n uh evolution by the

4558
03:52:42,040 --> 03:52:44,359
natural selection we all know about the

4559
03:52:44,359 --> 03:52:47,319
natural selection

4560
03:52:50,479 --> 03:52:53,760
right natural selection is the process

4561
03:52:53,760 --> 03:52:57,040
by which organisms that are best suited

4562
03:52:57,040 --> 03:52:59,920
for environment survive and reproduce

4563
03:52:59,920 --> 03:53:02,640
some evidences are given below let's

4564
03:53:02,640 --> 03:53:05,040
talk about

4565
03:53:05,239 --> 03:53:06,960
it

4566
03:53:06,960 --> 03:53:12,239
yes AA Raj grow said ma'am convergent or

4567
03:53:12,239 --> 03:53:14,840
diverent please explain okay yes this is

4568
03:53:14,840 --> 03:53:18,080
cbsc going on okay so uh convergent and

4569
03:53:18,080 --> 03:53:19,720
divalution good question Raj Raj I'll

4570
03:53:19,720 --> 03:53:22,279
tell you convergent

4571
03:53:22,279 --> 03:53:26,640
see first homology you remember homology

4572
03:53:26,640 --> 03:53:31,199
or homologous organ this show divergent

4573
03:53:31,199 --> 03:53:34,159
evolution now everybody Focus here now

4574
03:53:34,159 --> 03:53:37,960
I'll give you a a very important data

4575
03:53:37,960 --> 03:53:42,359
here right if I talk about

4576
03:53:42,359 --> 03:53:47,920
convergent sorry if I talk about

4577
03:53:47,920 --> 03:53:50,560
analogy it gives us an idea of

4578
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:53,520
convergent evolution of how to

4579
03:53:53,520 --> 03:53:57,279
remember in summer

4580
03:53:57,279 --> 03:54:00,880
nowadays nowadays in summer what do we

4581
03:54:00,880 --> 03:54:04,319
like most we should have a TV and if

4582
03:54:04,319 --> 03:54:08,199
that TV is HD then the by it's like

4583
03:54:08,199 --> 03:54:09,600
party for us

4584
03:54:09,600 --> 03:54:12,040
and if we have AC that is also party for

4585
03:54:12,040 --> 03:54:15,159
us so h d a these are the things which

4586
03:54:15,159 --> 03:54:17,319
are which we want in summer HD

4587
03:54:17,319 --> 03:54:21,040
television and an AC so h means homology

4588
03:54:21,040 --> 03:54:23,239
divergent evolution analogy convergent

4589
03:54:23,239 --> 03:54:26,600
evolution done this point clear then

4590
03:54:26,600 --> 03:54:28,720
let's talk about the adaptive radiation

4591
03:54:28,720 --> 03:54:30,800
up they let's look at the adaptive

4592
03:54:30,800 --> 03:54:32,640
radiation

4593
03:54:32,640 --> 03:54:36,760
Raj adaptive

4594
03:54:37,880 --> 03:54:40,640
radiation

4595
03:54:40,640 --> 03:54:44,000
now there are group of

4596
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:46,640
animals right they have a common

4597
03:54:46,640 --> 03:54:49,800
origin but with time they were exposed

4598
03:54:49,800 --> 03:54:52,880
to different environmental condition and

4599
03:54:52,880 --> 03:54:54,760
they are R radiating in a different

4600
03:54:54,760 --> 03:54:57,840
direction at a particular location this

4601
03:54:57,840 --> 03:54:59,520
is termed as adaptive

4602
03:54:59,520 --> 03:55:01,840
radiation and this gives us an idea of

4603
03:55:01,840 --> 03:55:03,520
divergent

4604
03:55:03,520 --> 03:55:06,239
evolution yes Raj this gives us an idea

4605
03:55:06,239 --> 03:55:07,640
of divergent

4606
03:55:07,640 --> 03:55:10,319
evolution that diverging from a point

4607
03:55:10,319 --> 03:55:14,080
adaptive radiation in an area AB listen

4608
03:55:14,080 --> 03:55:16,520
now same thing same divergent evolution

4609
03:55:16,520 --> 03:55:20,199
in the same area is happening in another

4610
03:55:20,199 --> 03:55:22,880
species and they are very parallel to

4611
03:55:22,880 --> 03:55:25,760
each other parall if you look at this

4612
03:55:25,760 --> 03:55:28,560
one one is very similar to one here if

4613
03:55:28,560 --> 03:55:30,439
you look at the two two is very similar

4614
03:55:30,439 --> 03:55:32,159
to two here this is these are the

4615
03:55:32,159 --> 03:55:34,279
marsupial and these are the mammals

4616
03:55:34,279 --> 03:55:37,040
Australian marsupial and placental

4617
03:55:37,040 --> 03:55:40,520
mammals this I called it as convergent

4618
03:55:40,520 --> 03:55:42,920
evolution both are converging both are

4619
03:55:42,920 --> 03:55:45,159
converging individually they are showing

4620
03:55:45,159 --> 03:55:46,239
divergent evolution but they're

4621
03:55:46,239 --> 03:55:49,840
converging also is this point clear

4622
03:55:49,840 --> 03:55:55,760
Raj yes tanu clear everyone no

4623
03:55:58,760 --> 03:56:02,159
doubt why you guys talk so

4624
03:56:02,159 --> 03:56:04,920
much

4625
03:56:04,920 --> 03:56:10,720
okay so let's start uh one second

4626
03:56:11,159 --> 03:56:14,359
and okay natural selection so natural

4627
03:56:14,359 --> 03:56:16,840
selection is naturally selected today we

4628
03:56:16,840 --> 03:56:18,960
have a neat exam with us we have a cbsc

4629
03:56:18,960 --> 03:56:22,479
exam with us that means someone is

4630
03:56:22,680 --> 03:56:26,080
checking ahuh right they both are

4631
03:56:26,080 --> 03:56:28,359
parallel evolution is occurring very

4632
03:56:28,359 --> 03:56:31,199
good very

4633
03:56:31,640 --> 03:56:35,399
nice okay now moving on to the next is

4634
03:56:35,399 --> 03:56:37,199
natural selection is something they are

4635
03:56:37,199 --> 03:56:38,960
checking naturally on the uh

4636
03:56:38,960 --> 03:56:41,520
capabilities if I say Corona with time

4637
03:56:41,520 --> 03:56:43,840
you know this covid came and those who

4638
03:56:43,840 --> 03:56:46,239
were better suited those who are having

4639
03:56:46,239 --> 03:56:48,239
a good immunity they were selected by

4640
03:56:48,239 --> 03:56:50,279
nature and those who are having the bad

4641
03:56:50,279 --> 03:56:52,760
immunity they were eliminated by Nature

4642
03:56:52,760 --> 03:56:56,359
so that can be a kind of a natural

4643
03:56:56,359 --> 03:56:59,040
selection isn't it so that is also kind

4644
03:56:59,040 --> 03:57:02,399
of a natural selection now natural

4645
03:57:02,399 --> 03:57:05,960
selection here we have one more example

4646
03:57:05,960 --> 03:57:10,600
in around 1850

4647
03:57:12,319 --> 03:57:17,960
1850s in 1850 that is before

4648
03:57:21,040 --> 03:57:25,120
industrialization before

4649
03:57:30,880 --> 03:57:34,920
industrialization and after

4650
03:57:37,600 --> 03:57:40,600
industrialization

4651
03:57:48,880 --> 03:57:50,439
right

4652
03:57:50,439 --> 03:57:52,600
so before

4653
03:57:52,600 --> 03:57:55,600
industrialization

4654
03:57:56,479 --> 03:57:59,920
bitson B

4655
03:58:01,920 --> 03:58:05,479
area and bitson

4656
03:58:05,479 --> 03:58:08,600
carbonaria were the two species of M

4657
03:58:08,600 --> 03:58:13,159
moth these were the two species of

4658
03:58:13,199 --> 03:58:15,680
moth right these were the two species of

4659
03:58:15,680 --> 03:58:19,359
moth used to exist similarly here

4660
03:58:19,359 --> 03:58:22,760
also V

4661
03:58:27,560 --> 03:58:32,800
area and it's in carbon

4662
03:58:35,159 --> 03:58:38,120
area these were the species who used to

4663
03:58:38,120 --> 03:58:40,080
exist

4664
03:58:40,080 --> 03:58:43,120
right because industrialize indust uh

4665
03:58:43,120 --> 03:58:45,120
industrialization was not there so this

4666
03:58:45,120 --> 03:58:47,880
was the tree right tree tree tree tree

4667
03:58:47,880 --> 03:58:52,359
tree tree so you know the tree the bark

4668
03:58:52,359 --> 03:58:55,000
was covered with

4669
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:58,080
lyans bark was covered with lyans and

4670
03:58:58,080 --> 03:59:00,399
lyans you all know lyans grow only in

4671
03:59:00,399 --> 03:59:02,720
that area where pollution is not there

4672
03:59:02,720 --> 03:59:04,800
so when there was no pollution so at

4673
03:59:04,800 --> 03:59:07,359
that particular time bitson bit area

4674
03:59:07,359 --> 03:59:10,399
bitson bit area was the light colored

4675
03:59:10,399 --> 03:59:13,439
moth light color and these were the one

4676
03:59:13,439 --> 03:59:15,640
which were dark colored

4677
03:59:15,640 --> 03:59:18,960
moth so their number the light colored

4678
03:59:18,960 --> 03:59:21,199
Mo number was really very high the

4679
03:59:21,199 --> 03:59:23,080
reason is they used to hide on this

4680
03:59:23,080 --> 03:59:25,560
lyans dark color they were completely

4681
03:59:25,560 --> 03:59:27,920
visible that is the reason their number

4682
03:59:27,920 --> 03:59:31,239
was really very

4683
03:59:31,239 --> 03:59:34,720
less with time natural selection

4684
03:59:34,720 --> 03:59:37,239
came right natural selection came so

4685
03:59:37,239 --> 03:59:40,600
natural selection the bits and bit area

4686
03:59:40,600 --> 03:59:43,120
which were light in color and here what

4687
03:59:43,120 --> 03:59:45,439
happened was this was a

4688
03:59:45,439 --> 03:59:49,520
tree this was a tree so on the tree

4689
03:59:49,520 --> 03:59:51,920
there was there were no Likens so the

4690
03:59:51,920 --> 03:59:53,760
bark was

4691
03:59:53,760 --> 03:59:57,159
dark so the bark was really very dark

4692
03:59:57,159 --> 03:59:59,920
you know the bark is really dark so dark

4693
03:59:59,920 --> 04:00:03,880
used to hide so their number was

4694
04:00:03,880 --> 04:00:07,359
more and their number was

4695
04:00:07,359 --> 04:00:09,720
less

4696
04:00:09,720 --> 04:00:12,720
so in England before industrialization

4697
04:00:12,720 --> 04:00:15,199
there were more white winged Mo white

4698
04:00:15,199 --> 04:00:18,960
light color tree uh on trees then dark

4699
04:00:18,960 --> 04:00:21,199
winged or melanized moth after

4700
04:00:21,199 --> 04:00:23,680
industrialization more dark winged moth

4701
04:00:23,680 --> 04:00:25,920
and less White Winged Mo mods were

4702
04:00:25,920 --> 04:00:28,439
developed so it is like a industrialized

4703
04:00:28,439 --> 04:00:32,520
it is like a natural selection natural

4704
04:00:32,520 --> 04:00:36,760
selection okay now reason before

4705
04:00:36,760 --> 04:00:39,159
industrialization there were white lyans

4706
04:00:39,159 --> 04:00:41,960
covered the tree in that background

4707
04:00:41,960 --> 04:00:45,080
white winged moth survived but dark

4708
04:00:45,080 --> 04:00:49,560
winged moth were picked out by the

4709
04:00:51,239 --> 04:00:53,800
Predators right now after

4710
04:00:53,800 --> 04:00:56,239
industrialization the tree trunks became

4711
04:00:56,239 --> 04:00:58,880
dark they became dark because lyans were

4712
04:00:58,880 --> 04:01:01,399
not there as lyans were not there so

4713
04:01:01,399 --> 04:01:04,720
bark was visible Park is dark due to

4714
04:01:04,720 --> 04:01:07,680
Industrial smoke and suit no growth of

4715
04:01:07,680 --> 04:01:08,880
lyans

4716
04:01:08,880 --> 04:01:11,080
under this condition The White Winged

4717
04:01:11,080 --> 04:01:15,000
moth did not survive because of Predator

4718
04:01:15,000 --> 04:01:17,840
identified them easily dark winged moth

4719
04:01:17,840 --> 04:01:22,640
survived because of suitable dark

4720
04:01:23,279 --> 04:01:27,359
background is this point clear clear to

4721
04:01:27,359 --> 04:01:29,399
everyone

4722
04:01:29,399 --> 04:01:32,920
now now let's talk about theories of

4723
04:01:32,920 --> 04:01:35,080
evolution now what we have discussed so

4724
04:01:35,080 --> 04:01:37,720
far let's do a quick revision we talked

4725
04:01:37,720 --> 04:01:41,159
about the origin of Earth then we talked

4726
04:01:41,159 --> 04:01:44,680
about origin of Life various theories

4727
04:01:44,680 --> 04:01:47,120
then we talked about the chemical

4728
04:01:47,120 --> 04:01:48,880
evolution in chemical Evolution we

4729
04:01:48,880 --> 04:01:50,520
talked about the Miller and Ur

4730
04:01:50,520 --> 04:01:52,960
experiment and after that Miller and Ur

4731
04:01:52,960 --> 04:01:54,680
experiment we talked about the evidences

4732
04:01:54,680 --> 04:01:57,479
of evolution paleontological evidences

4733
04:01:57,479 --> 04:01:59,399
comparative anatomy and morphology

4734
04:01:59,399 --> 04:02:00,640
evidences we talked about the

4735
04:02:00,640 --> 04:02:03,439
embryological evidences we talked about

4736
04:02:03,439 --> 04:02:06,120
biochemical evidences we talked about

4737
04:02:06,120 --> 04:02:08,600
biogeographical evidences then the

4738
04:02:08,600 --> 04:02:12,040
evidences from the natural

4739
04:02:13,080 --> 04:02:16,080
selection

4740
04:02:16,239 --> 04:02:20,040
okay now theories of evolution in

4741
04:02:20,040 --> 04:02:22,279
theories now we have to come back

4742
04:02:22,279 --> 04:02:24,319
everything whatever we have studied now

4743
04:02:24,319 --> 04:02:26,880
we have to correlate everything so by

4744
04:02:26,880 --> 04:02:28,600
looking at this evidences some

4745
04:02:28,600 --> 04:02:30,760
scientists they came to this idea so

4746
04:02:30,760 --> 04:02:34,159
first was a lamaris lamaris in detail is

4747
04:02:34,159 --> 04:02:37,319
not given in your uh you know ncrt

4748
04:02:37,319 --> 04:02:39,359
theory of inherit of acquired character

4749
04:02:39,359 --> 04:02:41,199
this was a theory which was given by

4750
04:02:41,199 --> 04:02:45,319
John Baptista D Lamar Right theory of

4751
04:02:45,319 --> 04:02:47,399
inheritance of acquired characteristics

4752
04:02:47,399 --> 04:02:49,920
is the first theory of organic

4753
04:02:49,920 --> 04:02:52,439
evolution now what was this Theory all

4754
04:02:52,439 --> 04:02:55,000
about theory is all about if I want to

4755
04:02:55,000 --> 04:02:59,159
change I can change if I want my neck

4756
04:02:59,159 --> 04:03:02,000
should be long I can increase the length

4757
04:03:02,000 --> 04:03:05,520
of the neck if I want to increase my

4758
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:08,640
muscle size I can do that so every

4759
04:03:08,640 --> 04:03:10,960
individual they have some internal vital

4760
04:03:10,960 --> 04:03:13,760
force and by altering that internal

4761
04:03:13,760 --> 04:03:16,880
vital force I can do anything whatever I

4762
04:03:16,880 --> 04:03:20,680
want to do what they said they said

4763
04:03:20,680 --> 04:03:23,760
internal vital force effect of

4764
04:03:23,760 --> 04:03:26,840
environment and new need if I want to

4765
04:03:26,840 --> 04:03:29,560
increase the length of my neck I can

4766
04:03:29,560 --> 04:03:31,560
increase the length of my

4767
04:03:31,560 --> 04:03:34,680
neck effect of environment and new needs

4768
04:03:34,680 --> 04:03:37,640
use and disuse of organ more I will use

4769
04:03:37,640 --> 04:03:41,680
one or organ or I will use one organ the

4770
04:03:41,680 --> 04:03:43,479
length of that organ the size of that

4771
04:03:43,479 --> 04:03:45,199
organ will increase continuously I'm

4772
04:03:45,199 --> 04:03:47,920
talking to you so that means my vocal uh

4773
04:03:47,920 --> 04:03:50,040
vocal sack size should increase this is

4774
04:03:50,040 --> 04:03:52,560
what they said but which is not true

4775
04:03:52,560 --> 04:03:54,359
inheritance of acquired character

4776
04:03:54,359 --> 04:03:56,159
whatever changes I do in my life that

4777
04:03:56,159 --> 04:03:57,880
will be acquired to the Next Generation

4778
04:03:57,880 --> 04:04:00,399
this is what they said four points you

4779
04:04:00,399 --> 04:04:03,399
have to remember internal vital force

4780
04:04:03,399 --> 04:04:05,439
effect of environment and new needs use

4781
04:04:05,439 --> 04:04:07,640
and disuse of organ inheritance of

4782
04:04:07,640 --> 04:04:09,399
acquired character this was given by

4783
04:04:09,399 --> 04:04:12,199
John Baptist D lar in the theory

4784
04:04:12,199 --> 04:04:14,680
inheritance of acquired

4785
04:04:14,680 --> 04:04:17,479
characters okay clear

4786
04:04:17,479 --> 04:04:19,000
everyone

4787
04:04:19,000 --> 04:04:23,359
now now see this is what they said he

4788
04:04:23,359 --> 04:04:27,720
said there was a giraffe so Here Giraffe

4789
04:04:27,720 --> 04:04:30,399
wanted to have some green grasses which

4790
04:04:30,399 --> 04:04:33,720
were on top of the tree so they extended

4791
04:04:33,720 --> 04:04:34,640
the

4792
04:04:34,640 --> 04:04:37,399
neck similarly so their neck size

4793
04:04:37,399 --> 04:04:40,040
increased so their child their kids were

4794
04:04:40,040 --> 04:04:43,279
having a you know a blong neck this is

4795
04:04:43,279 --> 04:04:45,560
what they said which you all know it's

4796
04:04:45,560 --> 04:04:47,640
not

4797
04:04:47,640 --> 04:04:51,560
true now next come the scientist Darwin

4798
04:04:51,560 --> 04:04:53,920
now first I'll explain the same concept

4799
04:04:53,920 --> 04:04:58,040
what Darwin said Darwin said giraffe

4800
04:04:58,040 --> 04:05:02,199
Evolution was not because of the not

4801
04:05:02,199 --> 04:05:04,319
because of the extension not because of

4802
04:05:04,319 --> 04:05:08,040
the use it was like in the environment

4803
04:05:08,040 --> 04:05:10,479
there were giraffe who were having long

4804
04:05:10,479 --> 04:05:12,720
neck there were giraffe who were having

4805
04:05:12,720 --> 04:05:16,120
small neck because leaves which were

4806
04:05:16,120 --> 04:05:17,840
near to the ground they

4807
04:05:17,840 --> 04:05:20,640
vanished with time those which were

4808
04:05:20,640 --> 04:05:22,720
having the small neck they were not able

4809
04:05:22,720 --> 04:05:25,159
to feed they

4810
04:05:25,159 --> 04:05:28,880
die they die and other who were having

4811
04:05:28,880 --> 04:05:30,720
the long neck they

4812
04:05:30,720 --> 04:05:33,840
survived and now as they survived they

4813
04:05:33,840 --> 04:05:36,479
were reproducing and now we have is we

4814
04:05:36,479 --> 04:05:38,399
have that giraffe which is is having a

4815
04:05:38,399 --> 04:05:41,720
long neck now let's have a look let's

4816
04:05:41,720 --> 04:05:45,920
read this Darin Darwinism Darin theory

4817
04:05:45,920 --> 04:05:47,880
is also termed as theory of natural

4818
04:05:47,880 --> 04:05:51,080
selection proposed jointly by the

4819
04:05:51,080 --> 04:05:54,880
Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel valis

4820
04:05:54,880 --> 04:05:57,840
he was maluski there was a theory of

4821
04:05:57,840 --> 04:05:59,800
population he was very much influenced

4822
04:05:59,800 --> 04:06:01,399
by the theory of

4823
04:06:01,399 --> 04:06:03,720
population so he came up with these

4824
04:06:03,720 --> 04:06:06,080
features you can easily correlate both

4825
04:06:06,080 --> 04:06:06,800
of

4826
04:06:06,800 --> 04:06:09,159
this

4827
04:06:09,159 --> 04:06:11,680
right first over production each

4828
04:06:11,680 --> 04:06:13,880
individual they have a capacity to

4829
04:06:13,880 --> 04:06:16,760
reproduce at maximum they can reach

4830
04:06:16,760 --> 04:06:18,800
their biotic potential they can produce

4831
04:06:18,800 --> 04:06:21,800
n number of Offspring struggle for

4832
04:06:21,800 --> 04:06:25,560
existence they all struggle so that they

4833
04:06:25,560 --> 04:06:28,159
can be they can you know they can

4834
04:06:28,159 --> 04:06:30,960
survive they always struggle variation

4835
04:06:30,960 --> 04:06:33,680
and heridity all are different from each

4836
04:06:33,680 --> 04:06:36,720
other all are not same they said

4837
04:06:36,720 --> 04:06:39,239
heridity they can can't transfer the

4838
04:06:39,239 --> 04:06:41,760
things from one generation to

4839
04:06:41,760 --> 04:06:45,399
another only those which are best suited

4840
04:06:45,399 --> 04:06:48,439
will be selected by Nature this is the

4841
04:06:48,439 --> 04:06:50,439
New Concept which he introduced he

4842
04:06:50,439 --> 04:06:52,840
introduced the concept of variation also

4843
04:06:52,840 --> 04:06:54,800
he introduces the concept of the natural

4844
04:06:54,800 --> 04:06:57,319
selection also and origin of new species

4845
04:06:57,319 --> 04:06:59,520
these are the points which he

4846
04:06:59,520 --> 04:07:01,680
mentioned

4847
04:07:01,680 --> 04:07:04,000
clear

4848
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:08,640
clear okay so moving on to the next is

4849
04:07:08,640 --> 04:07:10,960
now theory of natural selection now

4850
04:07:10,960 --> 04:07:14,199
theory of natural selection may we have

4851
04:07:14,199 --> 04:07:16,880
is this Theory which is a mutation

4852
04:07:16,880 --> 04:07:20,479
Theory mutation Theory mutation Theory

4853
04:07:20,479 --> 04:07:25,359
gave some ideas regarding the darnis but

4854
04:07:25,359 --> 04:07:28,920
he modified that also he said variations

4855
04:07:28,920 --> 04:07:32,359
are very Smalls he said whatever Darin

4856
04:07:32,359 --> 04:07:34,960
mentioned he there are variation there

4857
04:07:34,960 --> 04:07:38,319
are changes they are very small and he

4858
04:07:38,319 --> 04:07:40,640
did not explain the reason behind the

4859
04:07:40,640 --> 04:07:43,080
variation that was the biggest drawback

4860
04:07:43,080 --> 04:07:46,000
of Darwin so he mutation Theory came and

4861
04:07:46,000 --> 04:07:49,239
mutation Theory explained the reasons

4862
04:07:49,239 --> 04:07:52,920
for variation he said mutation is one of

4863
04:07:52,920 --> 04:07:56,600
the Reason by which variation

4864
04:07:56,600 --> 04:08:00,359
come mutation theory was put forward in

4865
04:08:00,359 --> 04:08:04,119
1901 by Hugo devies he conducted an

4866
04:08:04,119 --> 04:08:07,000
experiment of ooal larana that is a

4867
04:08:07,000 --> 04:08:09,399
evening Prim news he believed that

4868
04:08:09,399 --> 04:08:11,399
Evolution take place through mutation

4869
04:08:11,399 --> 04:08:14,000
not by minor variation whatever Darwin

4870
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:15,840
said Darwin said variations are there

4871
04:08:15,840 --> 04:08:17,479
changes are there he did not explain

4872
04:08:17,479 --> 04:08:19,119
what all variations are there what are

4873
04:08:19,119 --> 04:08:21,319
the reasons for it but he was able to

4874
04:08:21,319 --> 04:08:25,600
explain it Darian variation is minor

4875
04:08:25,600 --> 04:08:28,040
slow and directional he said ke whatever

4876
04:08:28,040 --> 04:08:30,479
changes are happening he said can be due

4877
04:08:30,479 --> 04:08:33,199
to the meosis but they are very slow

4878
04:08:33,199 --> 04:08:35,439
minor and Direction uh they are having a

4879
04:08:35,439 --> 04:08:38,159
particular direction due to this gradual

4880
04:08:38,159 --> 04:08:40,800
Evolution occur the reason behind the

4881
04:08:40,800 --> 04:08:43,680
evolution well this can lead to a very

4882
04:08:43,680 --> 04:08:47,560
slow Evolution now mutation he said ke

4883
04:08:47,560 --> 04:08:50,080
mutation whatever I have explained

4884
04:08:50,080 --> 04:08:52,960
mutation mutation is sudden random

4885
04:08:52,960 --> 04:08:55,880
directionless variation here speciation

4886
04:08:55,880 --> 04:08:57,800
is a saltation and what is a saltation

4887
04:08:57,800 --> 04:08:59,920
saltation is a single step large

4888
04:08:59,920 --> 04:09:02,119
mutation and because of that large

4889
04:09:02,119 --> 04:09:05,040
mutation today Evolution can happen is

4890
04:09:05,040 --> 04:09:07,880
the origin of evolution it's a or of

4891
04:09:07,880 --> 04:09:10,680
variation of

4892
04:09:11,479 --> 04:09:14,960
humans Okay

4893
04:09:14,960 --> 04:09:17,960
C

4894
04:09:18,760 --> 04:09:21,800
now now let's move on to the next topic

4895
04:09:21,800 --> 04:09:24,359
which is a hardi vug

4896
04:09:24,359 --> 04:09:27,680
equilibrium clear Hardy so let's see

4897
04:09:27,680 --> 04:09:29,319
theories of evolution May first we

4898
04:09:29,319 --> 04:09:31,159
talked about the lar Theory you have to

4899
04:09:31,159 --> 04:09:33,960
remember the complete name of Lamar the

4900
04:09:33,960 --> 04:09:35,920
theory acquired character Theory which

4901
04:09:35,920 --> 04:09:38,080
he gave then we talked about about the

4902
04:09:38,080 --> 04:09:40,359
points in the lar Theory then we talked

4903
04:09:40,359 --> 04:09:42,479
about the Darin theory different point

4904
04:09:42,479 --> 04:09:44,439
related to the darn Theory and then we

4905
04:09:44,439 --> 04:09:46,119
talked about the mutation Theory given

4906
04:09:46,119 --> 04:09:48,600
by the Hugo deves now we are discussing

4907
04:09:48,600 --> 04:09:51,800
the hardi vug equilibrium so hardy vug

4908
04:09:51,800 --> 04:09:54,199
equilibrium is another equilibrium this

4909
04:09:54,199 --> 04:09:58,920
tells he Gene

4910
04:10:00,479 --> 04:10:02,720
frequency gen

4911
04:10:02,720 --> 04:10:04,560
frequency

4912
04:10:04,560 --> 04:10:09,439
of randomly meeting

4913
04:10:10,080 --> 04:10:14,800
randomly meeting panmictic

4914
04:10:20,279 --> 04:10:24,040
population meting population 10 to

4915
04:10:24,040 --> 04:10:26,399
remain

4916
04:10:26,960 --> 04:10:30,080
constant 10 to

4917
04:10:30,080 --> 04:10:33,080
remain

4918
04:10:33,439 --> 04:10:35,800
constant

4919
04:10:35,800 --> 04:10:39,159
if no

4920
04:10:39,159 --> 04:10:42,159
external

4921
04:10:43,479 --> 04:10:48,119
force is acting on

4922
04:10:50,520 --> 04:10:53,840
it he said whatever genes are now we

4923
04:10:53,840 --> 04:10:55,119
know the genes

4924
04:10:55,119 --> 04:10:58,880
are okay now we

4925
04:10:59,040 --> 04:11:01,479
know right

4926
04:11:01,479 --> 04:11:05,080
uh now we know what are the genes right

4927
04:11:05,080 --> 04:11:08,880
so genes frequency they always remain

4928
04:11:08,880 --> 04:11:11,239
constant from one generation to another

4929
04:11:11,239 --> 04:11:13,560
until unless some force act on it now

4930
04:11:13,560 --> 04:11:15,960
what all Force did he talk about it he

4931
04:11:15,960 --> 04:11:18,080
said there are some factors which affect

4932
04:11:18,080 --> 04:11:21,279
this equilibrium he said the equilibrium

4933
04:11:21,279 --> 04:11:23,680
that remains is like this

4934
04:11:23,680 --> 04:11:28,159
p² + Q ² + 2

4935
04:11:28,159 --> 04:11:34,119
PQ is equal to 1 or p + Q is equal to 1

4936
04:11:34,119 --> 04:11:36,359
this is what they

4937
04:11:36,359 --> 04:11:39,359
said

4938
04:11:40,840 --> 04:11:44,399
this is what they said what is P

4939
04:11:44,399 --> 04:11:49,880
Square p sare is the frequency of a

4940
04:11:49,880 --> 04:11:52,880

4942
04:11:54,800 --> 04:11:57,479
G

4943
04:11:57,479 --> 04:12:00,880

4946
04:12:06,279 --> 04:12:09,279
homozygous

4947
04:12:13,960 --> 04:12:17,520

4948
04:12:17,520 --> 04:12:21,040

4953
04:12:40,520 --> 04:12:42,840
2pq is

4954
04:12:42,840 --> 04:12:46,439
the gene

4955
04:12:47,199 --> 04:12:48,720

zygotes heto

4958
04:12:59,520 --> 04:13:03,840
zot clear now next is what is p and Q

4959
04:13:03,840 --> 04:13:08,960
what is p p is a liic fre

4960
04:13:08,960 --> 04:13:12,479
quency alic frequency it's not a gene

4961
04:13:12,479 --> 04:13:14,600
frequency it's an alic

4962
04:13:14,600 --> 04:13:20,159
frequency right and Q is alic frequency

4963
04:13:20,159 --> 04:13:24,520
of of dominant

4964
04:13:28,399 --> 04:13:30,920
Al and this is the frequency of a

4965
04:13:30,920 --> 04:13:33,439
recessive

4966
04:13:34,680 --> 04:13:37,359
Al this is also Gene frequency of a

4967
04:13:37,359 --> 04:13:40,199
recessive Al and the dominant right now

4968
04:13:40,199 --> 04:13:43,119
they say it's not equal to one whenever

4969
04:13:43,119 --> 04:13:44,640
there is Gene

4970
04:13:44,640 --> 04:13:46,439
recombination Whenever there is a

4971
04:13:46,439 --> 04:13:48,520
mutation Whenever there is a gene

4972
04:13:48,520 --> 04:13:50,080
genetic drift which is also termed as

4973
04:13:50,080 --> 04:13:52,199
cival right effect there's a gene flow

4974
04:13:52,199 --> 04:13:54,080
and there's a natural flow these are the

4975
04:13:54,080 --> 04:13:56,520
they said ke these are the factors which

4976
04:13:56,520 --> 04:14:00,520
actually affect the equilibrium now what

4977
04:14:00,520 --> 04:14:03,080
why we are studying this there must be

4978
04:14:03,080 --> 04:14:05,119
some reason why we are studying why we

4979
04:14:05,119 --> 04:14:06,479
are talking because these are the

4980
04:14:06,479 --> 04:14:08,880
reasons by which different species they

4981
04:14:08,880 --> 04:14:11,319
exert on they exist on this Earth's

4982
04:14:11,319 --> 04:14:13,439
surface that is a reason behind the

4983
04:14:13,439 --> 04:14:15,040
evolution these are the reason behind

4984
04:14:15,040 --> 04:14:17,680
the evolution this is what they say gen

4985
04:14:17,680 --> 04:14:20,239
recombination we all have studied meosis

4986
04:14:20,239 --> 04:14:22,000
recombination occur here and whenever

4987
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:23,880
there's a recombination the Hardy

4988
04:14:23,880 --> 04:14:26,000
equilibrium that means the species who

4989
04:14:26,000 --> 04:14:29,319
are actually in a normal Zone that means

4990
04:14:29,319 --> 04:14:31,159
there is no variation they will change

4991
04:14:31,159 --> 04:14:33,040
they will start showing the variation

4992
04:14:33,040 --> 04:14:36,279
mutation Sudden Change genetic drift

4993
04:14:36,279 --> 04:14:38,760
Sudden Change in a population genetic

4994
04:14:38,760 --> 04:14:41,840
drift Al frequency change sudden gene

4995
04:14:41,840 --> 04:14:43,760
flow people are migrating from one place

4996
04:14:43,760 --> 04:14:46,680
to another if we have a population here

4997
04:14:46,680 --> 04:14:48,439
right they do not show any variation if

4998
04:14:48,439 --> 04:14:50,040
something is coming from outside that

4999
04:14:50,040 --> 04:14:52,399
means some genes are being introduced if

5000
04:14:52,399 --> 04:14:54,080
something is going out genes are being

5001
04:14:54,080 --> 04:14:57,119
exited they're removed next is a natural

5002
04:14:57,119 --> 04:14:59,080
flow when there is a natural flow is

5003
04:14:59,080 --> 04:15:03,279
occuring so that case also there will be

5004
04:15:03,279 --> 04:15:06,000
change okay

5005
04:15:06,000 --> 04:15:09,000
now

5006
04:15:10,080 --> 04:15:14,720
now okay now let's talk about this

5007
04:15:14,720 --> 04:15:17,040
natural selection now let's talk about

5008
04:15:17,040 --> 04:15:20,920
Buddies the types of natural

5009
04:15:23,760 --> 04:15:26,760
selection

5010
04:15:27,479 --> 04:15:31,680
of natural

5011
04:15:33,359 --> 04:15:36,119
selection types of natural selection

5012
04:15:36,119 --> 04:15:38,600
let's discuss this let

5013
04:15:38,600 --> 04:15:41,760
me increase the AC

5014
04:15:41,760 --> 04:15:46,479
temperature second it's really hot

5015
04:15:55,640 --> 04:16:00,080
here one second buddies just a

5016
04:16:05,920 --> 04:16:08,920
second

5017
04:16:15,600 --> 04:16:19,159
yeah types of natural selection let's

5018
04:16:19,159 --> 04:16:24,119
discuss this okay now see if if

5019
04:16:24,119 --> 04:16:26,359
seriously you will be able to like if

5020
04:16:26,359 --> 04:16:28,159
you'll focus on this you'll be able to

5021
04:16:28,159 --> 04:16:31,479
understand everything okay uh just after

5022
04:16:31,479 --> 04:16:33,080
this chapter we will complete this

5023
04:16:33,080 --> 04:16:35,560
chapter then I'll give you a break right

5024
04:16:35,560 --> 04:16:37,600
now natural selection now this is a

5025
04:16:37,600 --> 04:16:39,279
population can you see this is a

5026
04:16:39,279 --> 04:16:40,920
population and this population is full

5027
04:16:40,920 --> 04:16:43,560
of rat now in this population you will

5028
04:16:43,560 --> 04:16:46,520
see some white rats are there some

5029
04:16:46,520 --> 04:16:48,359
medium color rats are there and some

5030
04:16:48,359 --> 04:16:51,040
dark color rats are also there right can

5031
04:16:51,040 --> 04:16:55,040
you see right now suppose suppose

5032
04:16:55,040 --> 04:16:57,199
something happened and because of that

5033
04:16:57,199 --> 04:17:00,399
something only dark colored are selected

5034
04:17:00,399 --> 04:17:02,640
this is termed as directional selection

5035
04:17:02,640 --> 04:17:04,359
something happened some natural

5036
04:17:04,359 --> 04:17:07,159
selection some force is acting on it so

5037
04:17:07,159 --> 04:17:08,840
in that case that will be termed as a

5038
04:17:08,840 --> 04:17:10,880
directional selection that is a

5039
04:17:10,880 --> 04:17:13,880
directional selection on One Direction

5040
04:17:13,880 --> 04:17:17,040
We Are selecting something for example

5041
04:17:17,040 --> 04:17:19,239
uh you know uh suddenly when we when we

5042
04:17:19,239 --> 04:17:21,680
started spraying DDT on all the insect

5043
04:17:21,680 --> 04:17:24,479
they become they became DDT resistant

5044
04:17:24,479 --> 04:17:26,600
all insect they become DDT resistant so

5045
04:17:26,600 --> 04:17:29,319
that is a insect resistance insect

5046
04:17:29,319 --> 04:17:32,119
resistant DDT resistance now next one is

5047
04:17:32,119 --> 04:17:35,199
this can you see diversifying selection

5048
04:17:35,199 --> 04:17:39,159
so here either this this or that either

5049
04:17:39,159 --> 04:17:42,199
this or that will be selected medium

5050
04:17:42,199 --> 04:17:44,479
people they were not selected one

5051
04:17:44,479 --> 04:17:46,199
particular phenotype was not selected

5052
04:17:46,199 --> 04:17:48,359
either this or that stabilizing

5053
04:17:48,359 --> 04:17:50,439
selection stabilizing selection only the

5054
04:17:50,439 --> 04:17:52,600
medium individual they are selected so

5055
04:17:52,600 --> 04:17:54,600
this is what it

5056
04:17:54,600 --> 04:17:58,279
is yes any doubt any doubt come on tell

5057
04:17:58,279 --> 04:18:00,920
me if you have any doubt you can ask me

5058
04:18:00,920 --> 04:18:03,720
come on uh we are about to finish this

5059
04:18:03,720 --> 04:18:06,399
chapter some more uh points are there we

5060
04:18:06,399 --> 04:18:07,960
will disc discuss

5061
04:18:07,960 --> 04:18:10,920
that so here you can take an example of

5062
04:18:10,920 --> 04:18:12,319
a human

5063
04:18:12,319 --> 04:18:15,359
height you can take an example of a

5064
04:18:15,359 --> 04:18:17,560
human

5065
04:18:17,560 --> 04:18:20,359
height and here buddies you can take an

5066
04:18:20,359 --> 04:18:23,520
example of a CLE cell

5067
04:18:28,159 --> 04:18:31,680
anemia CLE Cel anemia right and here the

5068
04:18:31,680 --> 04:18:33,840
DDT

5069
04:18:33,840 --> 04:18:38,720
resistance DD resistance

5070
04:18:39,040 --> 04:18:41,720
now CLE cell anemia means those who are

5071
04:18:41,720 --> 04:18:44,199
having HBS HBS both the AL will not be

5072
04:18:44,199 --> 04:18:45,760
able to survive the those who are having

5073
04:18:45,760 --> 04:18:48,359
HBA and HBS they will survive and those

5074
04:18:48,359 --> 04:18:51,960
who are HB HB they are already surviving

5075
04:18:51,960 --> 04:18:54,800
now human height we all know medium

5076
04:18:54,800 --> 04:18:57,760
person they are always

5077
04:18:58,800 --> 04:19:00,520
selected

5078
04:19:00,520 --> 04:19:04,479
now let's talk about evolution of plants

5079
04:19:04,479 --> 04:19:06,760
so how plants evolved let's have a look

5080
04:19:06,760 --> 04:19:09,040
look you all know we are evolved from

5081
04:19:09,040 --> 04:19:11,399
the plants are evolved from the chloride

5082
04:19:11,399 --> 04:19:16,159
an ancestors chloride to Tropi to Ria to

5083
04:19:16,159 --> 04:19:20,239
sopyan and from copian the synops sits

5084
04:19:20,239 --> 04:19:24,279
the ferns the genos the conifers knail

5085
04:19:24,279 --> 04:19:27,279
pyet everything angiosperms dcot Etc

5086
04:19:27,279 --> 04:19:29,319
everything evolved from this now

5087
04:19:29,319 --> 04:19:31,399
question comes if I talk about the

5088
04:19:31,399 --> 04:19:34,199
Brophy brop fyes are evolved from the

5089
04:19:34,199 --> 04:19:37,560
chlorophytes ancestors Brites if I talk

5090
04:19:37,560 --> 04:19:40,520
about the lycopods lorts they evolved

5091
04:19:40,520 --> 04:19:44,119
from the troyes so this gives us an idea

5092
04:19:44,119 --> 04:19:46,159
how Evolution

5093
04:19:46,159 --> 04:19:49,359
happened similar trend has been seen in

5094
04:19:49,359 --> 04:19:53,000
case of the animals also here these are

5095
04:19:53,000 --> 04:19:55,199
the reptiles these are the early

5096
04:19:55,199 --> 04:19:57,640
reptiles which you all know they do not

5097
04:19:57,640 --> 04:20:01,119
exist anym if I talk about the from this

5098
04:20:01,119 --> 04:20:03,359
the two species they arise one is a

5099
04:20:03,359 --> 04:20:06,640
sorid and second is a synapsids from

5100
04:20:06,640 --> 04:20:11,080
from sopit copits we have Turtles we

5101
04:20:11,080 --> 04:20:15,000
have lizards we have the snakes we have

5102
04:20:15,000 --> 04:20:18,439
is taras we have is the those dinosaurs

5103
04:20:18,439 --> 04:20:21,199
toodon they are now do not have with us

5104
04:20:21,199 --> 04:20:23,640
the dinosaurs then the therapsids

5105
04:20:23,640 --> 04:20:26,439
they're not here with us the synapsids

5106
04:20:26,439 --> 04:20:29,560
were the one that ultimately give rise

5107
04:20:29,560 --> 04:20:31,279
to the

5108
04:20:31,279 --> 04:20:33,920
animals right how did we got to know

5109
04:20:33,920 --> 04:20:36,000
about it with the help of different

5110
04:20:36,000 --> 04:20:37,399
evidences of

5111
04:20:37,399 --> 04:20:41,119
evolution and how can we know that which

5112
04:20:41,119 --> 04:20:42,920
species how can we know that what's the

5113
04:20:42,920 --> 04:20:45,279
reason behind the evolution that we can

5114
04:20:45,279 --> 04:20:47,840
easily calculate with the help of the

5115
04:20:47,840 --> 04:20:49,840
Hardy wibur

5116
04:20:49,840 --> 04:20:53,279
equilibrium done

5117
04:20:53,279 --> 04:20:58,520
okay so now moving on to the Evol AA

5118
04:20:58,520 --> 04:21:00,640
there's one data regarding this 500

5119
04:21:00,640 --> 04:21:02,840
Millions years ago the first organism

5120
04:21:02,840 --> 04:21:05,600
who arise that was the invertebrates

5121
04:21:05,600 --> 04:21:08,800
were formed and Ive 350 jaw as fish is

5122
04:21:08,800 --> 04:21:13,119
evolved 320 seaweeds and few plants 350

5123
04:21:13,119 --> 04:21:16,760
again fish with a snout strong fins they

5124
04:21:16,760 --> 04:21:21,080
can move to the land and led fin kocan

5125
04:21:21,080 --> 04:21:22,840
was found in South Africa with that we

5126
04:21:22,840 --> 04:21:26,119
got to know he amphibians they evolved

5127
04:21:26,119 --> 04:21:27,439
from the fishes because these were the

5128
04:21:27,439 --> 04:21:29,800
fishes who can easily migrate to the

5129
04:21:29,800 --> 04:21:32,920
land right so from that the amphibians

5130
04:21:32,920 --> 04:21:35,279
low fil form the amphibians amphibians

5131
04:21:35,279 --> 04:21:37,359
into reptiles and dinosaur disappeared

5132
04:21:37,359 --> 04:21:40,199
in 650 Millions years ago why this data

5133
04:21:40,199 --> 04:21:43,000
I'm discussing it's there in

5134
04:21:43,000 --> 04:21:45,080
ncrt

5135
04:21:45,080 --> 04:21:46,640
okay

5136
04:21:46,640 --> 04:21:51,720
now moving on to the next evolution of

5137
04:21:51,720 --> 04:21:55,119
man so there is a you

5138
04:21:55,119 --> 04:21:59,279
know uh you know a chart regarding this

5139
04:21:59,279 --> 04:22:03,279
the first organism that is the humanlike

5140
04:22:03,279 --> 04:22:06,760
creature 15 Millions years ago was SE

5141
04:22:06,760 --> 04:22:09,279
life was evolved 500 Millions years ago

5142
04:22:09,279 --> 04:22:13,040
life I am seeing humans the first human

5143
04:22:13,040 --> 04:22:15,880
evidence today we know that is the drop

5144
04:22:15,880 --> 04:22:18,560
pacus and dram pacus drop pacus they

5145
04:22:18,560 --> 04:22:20,319
were more

5146
04:22:20,319 --> 04:22:24,600
apik more apik and RAM pacus were more

5147
04:22:24,600 --> 04:22:27,319
humanlike they were evolved they used to

5148
04:22:27,319 --> 04:22:29,960
walk like gorillas and chimpanzee drop

5149
04:22:29,960 --> 04:22:32,840
pacus they were apik Ram pacus was one

5150
04:22:32,840 --> 04:22:35,199
like this was once asked in a neat

5151
04:22:35,199 --> 04:22:38,680
2016 then then came the 3 to 4 billions

5152
04:22:38,680 --> 04:22:41,560
years ago manlike primate height up to

5153
04:22:41,560 --> 04:22:44,680
4T fossils of manlike bones found in

5154
04:22:44,680 --> 04:22:46,720
Ethiopia and Tanzania and you know what

5155
04:22:46,720 --> 04:22:51,000
is that that is the

5156
04:22:51,159 --> 04:22:55,199
Australopithecus aop

5157
04:22:55,840 --> 04:22:58,159
pacus that is the

5158
04:22:58,159 --> 04:23:00,680
Australopithecus right these were the

5159
04:23:00,680 --> 04:23:03,199
organism so they were bodies you won't

5160
04:23:03,199 --> 04:23:05,279
believe they were having the

5161
04:23:05,279 --> 04:23:07,279
height

5162
04:23:07,279 --> 04:23:09,600
one

5163
04:23:10,920 --> 04:23:14,640
second yeah Australopithecus they were

5164
04:23:14,640 --> 04:23:17,800
having the height of around 4T fossils

5165
04:23:17,800 --> 04:23:20,560
manlike bone Ethiopia and Tanzania made

5166
04:23:20,560 --> 04:23:23,760
it was seen now next come the two

5167
04:23:23,760 --> 04:23:26,600
millions years ago in the 2 Millions

5168
04:23:26,600 --> 04:23:30,119
years ago there was a Homo habilis this

5169
04:23:30,119 --> 04:23:34,199
was Homo

5170
04:23:34,399 --> 04:23:38,279
habilis habilis

5171
04:23:38,720 --> 04:23:40,800
Homo

5172
04:23:40,800 --> 04:23:43,800
habilis lived in East African glassland

5173
04:23:43,800 --> 04:23:47,000
hunted with stone weapons ate fruit

5174
04:23:47,000 --> 04:23:50,319
clear homo heis first humanlike hominid

5175
04:23:50,319 --> 04:23:52,600
brain capacity yes their brain capacity

5176
04:23:52,600 --> 04:23:54,399
you have to write down that is around

5177
04:23:54,399 --> 04:23:58,920
650 to 800 CC and you know what was

5178
04:23:58,920 --> 04:24:01,640
their brain capacity Australopithecus

5179
04:24:01,640 --> 04:24:07,119
that was around 400 to 600 CC

5180
04:24:07,119 --> 04:24:10,720
this was there now 1.5 million year ago

5181
04:24:10,720 --> 04:24:12,840
Homo erectus Java man they were having

5182
04:24:12,840 --> 04:24:15,199
the brain capacity of around 900 CC they

5183
04:24:15,199 --> 04:24:17,439
used to eat

5184
04:24:17,439 --> 04:24:21,000
meat Now 1 lakh to 40,000 years ago

5185
04:24:21,000 --> 04:24:24,359
homon nandal schames brain capacity was,

5186
04:24:24,359 --> 04:24:27,600
1400 CC lived in East and Central Asia

5187
04:24:27,600 --> 04:24:29,840
used to hide and protect their body

5188
04:24:29,840 --> 04:24:31,760
buried their dead so they were more

5189
04:24:31,760 --> 04:24:35,279
civilized then came the 75,000 to 10,000

5190
04:24:35,279 --> 04:24:37,439
years ago homo sapiens Modern Man

5191
04:24:37,439 --> 04:24:40,720
prehistoric CA develop few years back

5192
04:24:40,720 --> 04:24:43,760
only and they developed the agriculture

5193
04:24:43,760 --> 04:24:45,319
so let's discuss everything let's

5194
04:24:45,319 --> 04:24:48,560
discuss this again racus racus

5195
04:24:48,560 --> 04:24:51,720
Australopithecus Homo habilis

5196
04:24:51,720 --> 04:24:54,680
see this is what we have studied right

5197
04:24:54,680 --> 04:24:57,880
racus racus then Australopithecus then

5198
04:24:57,880 --> 04:25:00,680
Homo habilis then Homo erectus after

5199
04:25:00,680 --> 04:25:03,279
homoerectus neanderthals they have is

5200
04:25:03,279 --> 04:25:05,680
homo neanderthals neanderthals after

5201
04:25:05,680 --> 04:25:08,760
that we have is a homo sapiens right do

5202
04:25:08,760 --> 04:25:10,720
it again let's do it again first came

5203
04:25:10,720 --> 04:25:14,359
drakus racus after drakus racus there we

5204
04:25:14,359 --> 04:25:16,040
have the Australopithecus after

5205
04:25:16,040 --> 04:25:18,040
Australopithecus Homo habilis Homo

5206
04:25:18,040 --> 04:25:20,479
erectus neanderthals and the homo

5207
04:25:20,479 --> 04:25:23,399
sapiens sapiens come on let's revise

5208
04:25:23,399 --> 04:25:25,159
this again everyone let's revise this

5209
04:25:25,159 --> 04:25:29,600
again first the racus rap pacus ostop

5210
04:25:29,600 --> 04:25:31,920
pacus after aop pacus we have a Homo

5211
04:25:31,920 --> 04:25:35,080
habilis homoerectus mandals and Homo

5212
04:25:35,080 --> 04:25:36,600
sapiens

5213
04:25:36,600 --> 04:25:38,560
clear for everyone you have to remember

5214
04:25:38,560 --> 04:25:40,600
the brain

5215
04:25:40,600 --> 04:25:44,920
capacities done done done done so guys

5216
04:25:44,920 --> 04:25:46,560
so with this we have completed the

5217
04:25:46,560 --> 04:25:48,960
chapter which is the evolution next we

5218
04:25:48,960 --> 04:25:51,279
have to start the biotechnology so

5219
04:25:51,279 --> 04:25:53,080
before biotechnology before starting the

5220
04:25:53,080 --> 04:25:55,760
biotechnology let's take a break right

5221
04:25:55,760 --> 04:25:58,960
let's take a break for the half an

5222
04:25:58,960 --> 04:26:03,040
hour right let's take a break for uh

5223
04:26:03,040 --> 04:26:04,600
like let's take a break for 20 minutes

5224
04:26:04,600 --> 04:26:06,600
20 minutes are enough

5225
04:26:06,600 --> 04:26:09,600
20

5226
04:26:09,960 --> 04:26:12,880
minutes let me check if I we have a

5227
04:26:12,880 --> 04:26:17,119
timer timer timer

5228
04:26:17,119 --> 04:26:18,650
timer

5229
04:26:18,650 --> 04:26:21,940
[Music]

5230
04:26:24,880 --> 04:26:30,119
uh yes we will meet just after 20

5231
04:26:30,479 --> 04:26:33,560
minutes 20

5232
04:26:33,560 --> 04:26:36,640
minutes right so we'll meet just after

5233
04:26:36,640 --> 04:26:39,159
20 minutes by the time let's make a take

5234
04:26:39,159 --> 04:26:44,439
a break bye-bye we not go don't go

5235
04:27:04,920 --> 04:27:07,920
guys

5236
04:47:10,400 --> 04:47:12,240
hey buddies are you getting my

5237
04:47:12,240 --> 04:47:15,440
voice come on come on come on tell me

5238
04:47:15,440 --> 04:47:19,680
tell me tell me yes break is over come

5239
04:47:19,680 --> 04:47:21,798
back now we are going to start a new

5240
04:47:21,798 --> 04:47:24,280
chapter which is biotechnology principle

5241
04:47:24,280 --> 04:47:25,680
and

5242
04:47:25,680 --> 04:47:28,400
processes yes so marathon is still going

5243
04:47:28,400 --> 04:47:31,200
on we are done with the five almost 5

5244
04:47:31,200 --> 04:47:36,080
hours are you guys getting my voice

5245
04:47:38,040 --> 04:47:41,440
yes great great great H great are you

5246
04:47:41,440 --> 04:47:44,440
getting my voice good so we are going to

5247
04:47:44,440 --> 04:47:47,120
start with the full energy now another

5248
04:47:47,120 --> 04:47:49,718
chapter three chapters done this is a

5249
04:47:49,718 --> 04:47:52,320
fourth chapter which we are starting and

5250
04:47:52,320 --> 04:47:53,920
we are starting with the biotechnology

5251
04:47:53,920 --> 04:47:55,600
principle and processes in the last we

5252
04:47:55,600 --> 04:47:57,600
will do human health and diseases yes

5253
04:47:57,600 --> 04:48:00,718
everybody ready now so how was your

5254
04:48:00,718 --> 04:48:04,360
three chapters it went well see how

5255
04:48:04,360 --> 04:48:07,558
dedicated we are we whole team of PW we

5256
04:48:07,558 --> 04:48:09,280
organize this session because you know

5257
04:48:09,280 --> 04:48:12,320
your next exam is your biology and what

5258
04:48:12,320 --> 04:48:15,240
we want is our students should do great

5259
04:48:15,240 --> 04:48:17,040
in

5260
04:48:17,040 --> 04:48:20,840
that yes very nice very

5261
04:48:20,840 --> 04:48:25,840
nice hi Prisha okay good good

5262
04:48:26,000 --> 04:48:29,718
good three chapters done yes okay so

5263
04:48:29,718 --> 04:48:31,878
let's start with the biotechnology

5264
04:48:31,878 --> 04:48:34,200
biotechnology principle and processes we

5265
04:48:34,200 --> 04:48:36,440
are starting

5266
04:48:36,440 --> 04:48:39,160
okay so before proceeding let's first

5267
04:48:39,160 --> 04:48:41,600
know what actually a biotechnology is so

5268
04:48:41,600 --> 04:48:44,280
biotechnology is all about

5269
04:48:44,280 --> 04:48:47,600
modifying right earlier we used to you

5270
04:48:47,600 --> 04:48:50,520
we used to uh you know take care of only

5271
04:48:50,520 --> 04:48:52,680
natural capabilities of

5272
04:48:52,680 --> 04:48:55,200
microorganisms like we know how to make

5273
04:48:55,200 --> 04:48:57,360
CTS you know there are some bacterias

5274
04:48:57,360 --> 04:48:59,680
who can give us antibiotics so we used

5275
04:48:59,680 --> 04:49:01,638
to just focus on that because that was

5276
04:49:01,638 --> 04:49:04,240
their natural capability now what we are

5277
04:49:04,240 --> 04:49:06,200
doing is with the help of a recombinant

5278
04:49:06,200 --> 04:49:08,718
DNA technology we are modifying those

5279
04:49:08,718 --> 04:49:11,600
microorganism so that we can use them

5280
04:49:11,600 --> 04:49:14,400
for the products and the services let's

5281
04:49:14,400 --> 04:49:16,760
have a look so what is a standard

5282
04:49:16,760 --> 04:49:20,760
definition of biotechnology given by efb

5283
04:49:20,760 --> 04:49:23,160
that is the European Federation of

5284
04:49:23,160 --> 04:49:25,440
biotechnology European Federation of

5285
04:49:25,440 --> 04:49:28,798
biotechnology says when we integrate

5286
04:49:28,798 --> 04:49:32,080
when we use the natural capability that

5287
04:49:32,080 --> 04:49:36,520
means natural sign means organism sells

5288
04:49:36,520 --> 04:49:39,958
part of their molecular analog for our

5289
04:49:39,958 --> 04:49:42,200
products and services this is termed as

5290
04:49:42,200 --> 04:49:45,120
the biotechnology let me first switch on

5291
04:49:45,120 --> 04:49:45,878
the

5292
04:49:45,878 --> 04:49:48,958
AC one second it's really very hard and

5293
04:49:48,958 --> 04:49:50,878
guys I'm telling you seriously it's so

5294
04:49:50,878 --> 04:49:53,000
difficult to stand in front of the

5295
04:49:53,000 --> 04:49:57,798
screen with just warit heat one

5296
04:50:02,840 --> 04:50:05,840
second

5297
04:50:13,160 --> 04:50:16,120
okay so this was given by European

5298
04:50:16,120 --> 04:50:17,878
Federation of biotechnology and this

5299
04:50:17,878 --> 04:50:19,480
European Federation of biotechnology

5300
04:50:19,480 --> 04:50:22,798
says we should we use of you know the

5301
04:50:22,798 --> 04:50:25,200
Natural Science products and the

5302
04:50:25,200 --> 04:50:28,600
services for various things right for

5303
04:50:28,600 --> 04:50:30,600
the products for the services Etc so

5304
04:50:30,600 --> 04:50:32,638
that comes under this this full form is

5305
04:50:32,638 --> 04:50:35,240
also important can be asked in one Mark

5306
04:50:35,240 --> 04:50:37,200
now let's move on to the next one

5307
04:50:37,200 --> 04:50:39,958
principles of biotechnology among many

5308
04:50:39,958 --> 04:50:41,878
the two core technique that enabl the

5309
04:50:41,878 --> 04:50:44,080
birth of the modern biotechnology are so

5310
04:50:44,080 --> 04:50:46,000
overall the biotechnology is made up of

5311
04:50:46,000 --> 04:50:47,798
two different component without these

5312
04:50:47,798 --> 04:50:49,360
two component biotechnology is

5313
04:50:49,360 --> 04:50:52,760
handicapped first thing is the genetic

5314
04:50:52,760 --> 04:50:54,360
engineering so what is a genetic

5315
04:50:54,360 --> 04:50:56,958
engineering genetic engineering means to

5316
04:50:56,958 --> 04:51:00,400
alter the DNA engineering we are using

5317
04:51:00,400 --> 04:51:03,840
the tools so that we can modify the DNA

5318
04:51:03,840 --> 04:51:06,080
techniques to alter the chemistry of a

5319
04:51:06,080 --> 04:51:08,638
genetic material either that can be DNA

5320
04:51:08,638 --> 04:51:11,920
or RNA to introduce this into the host

5321
04:51:11,920 --> 04:51:14,200
organism and thus change the phenotype

5322
04:51:14,200 --> 04:51:16,240
of the host organism genetic

5323
04:51:16,240 --> 04:51:18,480
engineering yes we are modifying the

5324
04:51:18,480 --> 04:51:20,360
gene genetic

5325
04:51:20,360 --> 04:51:23,280
engineering yes now moving on to the

5326
04:51:23,280 --> 04:51:26,600
next is second most important part is

5327
04:51:26,600 --> 04:51:29,320
bioprocess engineering now suppose this

5328
04:51:29,320 --> 04:51:32,760
is an organism this is an organism and

5329
04:51:32,760 --> 04:51:35,400
it is a cell right right this is the

5330
04:51:35,400 --> 04:51:37,798
chromosome you have modified it with the

5331
04:51:37,798 --> 04:51:39,440
help of a biotechnology with the help of

5332
04:51:39,440 --> 04:51:41,240
a recombinant DNA technology you have

5333
04:51:41,240 --> 04:51:43,558
introduced a gene right let me use

5334
04:51:43,558 --> 04:51:45,120
another color that will be more visible

5335
04:51:45,120 --> 04:51:47,558
to you so I have introduced this white

5336
04:51:47,558 --> 04:51:53,520
Gene here done now I want the product I

5337
04:51:53,520 --> 04:51:55,360
want the gene

5338
04:51:55,360 --> 04:51:58,240
product but how is it possible how much

5339
04:51:58,240 --> 04:52:01,240
product am I going to get by only uh you

5340
04:52:01,240 --> 04:52:03,120
know culturing a single cell not

5341
04:52:03,120 --> 04:52:04,558
possible Right

5342
04:52:04,558 --> 04:52:06,360
we will get only a small very little

5343
04:52:06,360 --> 04:52:08,480
amount of product so what will I do I

5344
04:52:08,480 --> 04:52:09,958
will use the technique which is termed

5345
04:52:09,958 --> 04:52:12,080
as bioprocess Engineering in the

5346
04:52:12,080 --> 04:52:15,840
bioprocess engineering what we do is we

5347
04:52:15,840 --> 04:52:18,360
culture these

5348
04:52:18,360 --> 04:52:22,840
cells we culture cells we culture cells

5349
04:52:22,840 --> 04:52:25,480
how we give them a particular

5350
04:52:25,480 --> 04:52:27,878
environment we give them a particular

5351
04:52:27,878 --> 04:52:30,400
temperature we provide them a particular

5352
04:52:30,400 --> 04:52:33,200
pH we culture them according to their

5353
04:52:33,200 --> 04:52:34,200
requirements

5354
04:52:34,200 --> 04:52:36,558
and then we extract our product out of

5355
04:52:36,558 --> 04:52:38,798
it that all comes under the bioprocess

5356
04:52:38,798 --> 04:52:41,040
engineering maintenance of sterile

5357
04:52:41,040 --> 04:52:43,360
microbial contamination free ambients in

5358
04:52:43,360 --> 04:52:45,240
chemical engineering process to enable

5359
04:52:45,240 --> 04:52:47,520
the growth of only desired microb

5360
04:52:47,520 --> 04:52:50,680
eukariotic cell that to in large

5361
04:52:50,680 --> 04:52:52,360
quantities for the manufacturer of

5362
04:52:52,360 --> 04:52:54,840
biotechnology product like antibiotics

5363
04:52:54,840 --> 04:52:58,080
vaccine enzymes Etc this aspect is

5364
04:52:58,080 --> 04:53:00,920
related to Pure culturing so this is

5365
04:53:00,920 --> 04:53:02,558
very much different from those culture

5366
04:53:02,558 --> 04:53:04,160
which we do in our labor

5367
04:53:04,160 --> 04:53:06,520
normal laboratory but in biotechnology

5368
04:53:06,520 --> 04:53:09,200
lab we use bioprocess Biore reactors are

5369
04:53:09,200 --> 04:53:11,320
there a huge bioreactors which has a

5370
04:53:11,320 --> 04:53:14,958
capacity of around 1,000 liter so there

5371
04:53:14,958 --> 04:53:17,480
fluid is there we provide culture medium

5372
04:53:17,480 --> 04:53:19,320
we provide temperature so that we can

5373
04:53:19,320 --> 04:53:21,320
culture those microorganism any

5374
04:53:21,320 --> 04:53:23,840
eukariotic cell whom we have modified

5375
04:53:23,840 --> 04:53:27,558
where we have introduced yes the gene of

5376
04:53:27,558 --> 04:53:32,520
Interest okay okie doie no recombinant

5377
04:53:32,520 --> 04:53:34,200
DNA technology so what actually the

5378
04:53:34,200 --> 04:53:36,200
recombinant DNA technology is then I'll

5379
04:53:36,200 --> 04:53:38,160
be telling you what was the first

5380
04:53:38,160 --> 04:53:41,520
recombinant U you know the DNA which

5381
04:53:41,520 --> 04:53:43,520
which was produced recombinant DNA

5382
04:53:43,520 --> 04:53:45,480
technology is all about see what we do

5383
04:53:45,480 --> 04:53:47,600
this is a plasmid which is a extra

5384
04:53:47,600 --> 04:53:50,798
chromosomal one right now the first

5385
04:53:50,798 --> 04:53:52,360
recombinant let's explain this with the

5386
04:53:52,360 --> 04:53:55,600
help of a first recombinant

5387
04:53:55,600 --> 04:53:58,000
DNA

5388
04:53:58,000 --> 04:54:01,000
first

5389
04:54:02,480 --> 04:54:05,480
recombinate

5390
04:54:05,840 --> 04:54:09,680
DNA molecule so how did we produce the

5391
04:54:09,680 --> 04:54:12,280
first recombinant DNA molecule so first

5392
04:54:12,280 --> 04:54:14,080
let's understand this first recombinant

5393
04:54:14,080 --> 04:54:16,080
first means very first recombinant means

5394
04:54:16,080 --> 04:54:18,120
new combination that means this is a

5395
04:54:18,120 --> 04:54:20,440
normal DNA and then this normal DNA I

5396
04:54:20,440 --> 04:54:23,240
have introduced something like this this

5397
04:54:23,240 --> 04:54:24,878
is a new recombinant this is a new

5398
04:54:24,878 --> 04:54:27,680
recombinant DNA and this was the first

5399
04:54:27,680 --> 04:54:29,600
of all this was produced by Stanley

5400
04:54:29,600 --> 04:54:35,480
Kohan and Herbert Boer this was done by

5401
04:54:37,200 --> 04:54:40,000
Stanley

5402
04:54:40,000 --> 04:54:42,120
Kohan

5403
04:54:42,120 --> 04:54:45,120
and

5404
04:54:45,120 --> 04:54:48,120
Herbert

5405
04:54:48,680 --> 04:54:51,558
Boer Stanley Gohan and Herbert Boyer and

5406
04:54:51,558 --> 04:54:53,320
when what this started that when did he

5407
04:54:53,320 --> 04:54:55,440
do this in

5408
04:54:55,440 --> 04:54:59,360
1972 9 years after the discovery of the

5409
04:54:59,360 --> 04:55:02,440
one very important tool that was a recom

5410
04:55:02,440 --> 04:55:04,920
uh that was the rtion endon nucleus that

5411
04:55:04,920 --> 04:55:06,160
was discovered in

5412
04:55:06,160 --> 04:55:08,920
1963 and this was done in

5413
04:55:08,920 --> 04:55:12,400
1972 now here now listen very carefully

5414
04:55:12,400 --> 04:55:13,958
this is a gene of Interest so what

5415
04:55:13,958 --> 04:55:16,000
scientist did they took a gene of

5416
04:55:16,000 --> 04:55:18,120
Interest this is a gene of interest and

5417
04:55:18,120 --> 04:55:20,958
this Gene of Interest was the antibiotic

5418
04:55:20,958 --> 04:55:23,080
resistance

5419
04:55:23,080 --> 04:55:24,878
Gene

5420
04:55:24,878 --> 04:55:27,878
antibiotic

5421
04:55:28,718 --> 04:55:31,480
resistance Gene and this antibiotic

5422
04:55:31,480 --> 04:55:35,120
resistant Gene was used this was cut

5423
04:55:35,120 --> 04:55:37,040
from here with the help of a restriction

5424
04:55:37,040 --> 04:55:38,798
enzyme these are the enzyme which was

5425
04:55:38,798 --> 04:55:41,760
discovered again I'm saying in the

5426
04:55:41,760 --> 04:55:44,680
1963 almost just check it whether I'm

5427
04:55:44,680 --> 04:55:47,878
100% sure it is 1963 so this was cut

5428
04:55:47,878 --> 04:55:50,280
from this place then the gene was

5429
04:55:50,280 --> 04:55:52,520
isolated antibiotic resistance Gene this

5430
04:55:52,520 --> 04:55:55,798
was a plasmid which was taken and here

5431
04:55:55,798 --> 04:55:58,040
the another Gene was introduced this was

5432
04:55:58,040 --> 04:56:00,240
a gene which was introduced this plasmid

5433
04:56:00,240 --> 04:56:05,320
was taken from salmonella typhimurium

5434
04:56:09,680 --> 04:56:12,200
Ty muum now all of you must be thinking

5435
04:56:12,200 --> 04:56:15,480
M what is salmona tyum salmona tyum is a

5436
04:56:15,480 --> 04:56:17,320
bacteria very much similar to that of

5437
04:56:17,320 --> 04:56:21,600
eoli and uh yes this was introduced with

5438
04:56:21,600 --> 04:56:23,320
the help of a ligase it was joined and

5439
04:56:23,320 --> 04:56:25,280
now we have is a modified plasmid and

5440
04:56:25,280 --> 04:56:27,120
this modified plasmas was introduced

5441
04:56:27,120 --> 04:56:28,000
into the

5442
04:56:28,000 --> 04:56:31,520
eoli this is what they did the first

5443
04:56:31,520 --> 04:56:34,680
recombinant DNA molecule which was which

5444
04:56:34,680 --> 04:56:36,558
the produced the question comes what is

5445
04:56:36,558 --> 04:56:40,200
a plasmid plasmid is a extra chromosomal

5446
04:56:40,200 --> 04:56:42,320
DNA this is a

5447
04:56:42,320 --> 04:56:46,440
cell in a bacterial cell we have the

5448
04:56:46,440 --> 04:56:49,040
plasmids these are the plasmids extra

5449
04:56:49,040 --> 04:56:50,760
chromosomal they have their own

5450
04:56:50,760 --> 04:56:53,798
bacterial uh you know bacterial

5451
04:56:53,798 --> 04:56:55,638
chromosome is also there but the

5452
04:56:55,638 --> 04:56:58,680
circular the double standard the plasmid

5453
04:56:58,680 --> 04:57:00,558
which is present they basically provide

5454
04:57:00,558 --> 04:57:02,520
this is what this is a plasmid so this

5455
04:57:02,520 --> 04:57:04,440
provides some extra properties like

5456
04:57:04,440 --> 04:57:07,440
antibiotic resistance Etc and Etc so

5457
04:57:07,440 --> 04:57:09,280
they scientist they just took out this

5458
04:57:09,280 --> 04:57:11,400
plasmid they took out this plasmid they

5459
04:57:11,400 --> 04:57:13,360
inserted the gene of interest in it and

5460
04:57:13,360 --> 04:57:15,280
again they have introduced this modified

5461
04:57:15,280 --> 04:57:18,440
plasmid into the ecoli this is what they

5462
04:57:18,440 --> 04:57:21,600
do right so yes plasmid is like a

5463
04:57:21,600 --> 04:57:23,680
carrier it's like how you go from one

5464
04:57:23,680 --> 04:57:25,760
place to another you book a cab either

5465
04:57:25,760 --> 04:57:28,600
you book a ob or a Ola or any other Taxi

5466
04:57:28,600 --> 04:57:31,520
you use similarly this is that

5467
04:57:31,520 --> 04:57:35,200
taxi right

5468
04:57:35,920 --> 04:57:38,878
okay now moving on to the next is now

5469
04:57:38,878 --> 04:57:42,000
let's talk about now we have to discuss

5470
04:57:42,000 --> 04:57:46,120
the major discoveries

5471
04:57:46,638 --> 04:57:50,160
May one second no another Discovery

5472
04:57:50,160 --> 04:57:52,080
another major important Discovery is

5473
04:57:52,080 --> 04:57:54,600
this restriction end endonuclease

5474
04:57:54,600 --> 04:57:57,558
restriction enzyme restriction enzym so

5475
04:57:57,558 --> 04:57:59,400
what are these restriction enzyme why we

5476
04:57:59,400 --> 04:58:01,798
call this as a restriction because they

5477
04:58:01,798 --> 04:58:05,120
were isolated from Bia first thing they

5478
04:58:05,120 --> 04:58:07,840
were

5479
04:58:07,920 --> 04:58:11,760
isolated from

5480
04:58:11,760 --> 04:58:13,878
bacteria that this is not the reason we

5481
04:58:13,878 --> 04:58:16,760
call it restricted but scientists

5482
04:58:16,760 --> 04:58:19,320
realized ke whenever a

5483
04:58:19,320 --> 04:58:22,240
bacteria is infected with a bacteria

5484
04:58:22,240 --> 04:58:24,920
phase they saw whenever a bacteria phase

5485
04:58:24,920 --> 04:58:26,680
infect a

5486
04:58:26,680 --> 04:58:29,080
bacteria they release their genome

5487
04:58:29,080 --> 04:58:31,120
inside bacteria phase they release their

5488
04:58:31,120 --> 04:58:33,320
genome inside the bacteria this This Is

5489
04:58:33,320 --> 04:58:36,718
How They infect bacteria has this

5490
04:58:36,718 --> 04:58:40,000
capacity that they produce some enzyme

5491
04:58:40,000 --> 04:58:42,000
which is termed as the restriction

5492
04:58:42,000 --> 04:58:45,360
enzymes they produce re right in the

5493
04:58:45,360 --> 04:58:47,200
cell in the cell they will produce the

5494
04:58:47,200 --> 04:58:49,878
re they have this natural

5495
04:58:49,878 --> 04:58:53,040
capacity and what this AR will do they

5496
04:58:53,040 --> 04:58:55,840
will kill they will cut the DNA into

5497
04:58:55,840 --> 04:58:59,920
fragments so it cut the

5498
04:58:59,920 --> 04:59:03,878
DNA foreign DNA into fragment not the

5499
04:59:03,878 --> 04:59:07,360
native one foreign

5500
04:59:07,680 --> 04:59:11,200
DNA into

5501
04:59:11,200 --> 04:59:13,798
fragments this can be asked in one

5502
04:59:13,798 --> 04:59:16,600
marker why we call this as restriction

5503
04:59:16,600 --> 04:59:18,958
so it cut the DNA into the fragment and

5504
04:59:18,958 --> 04:59:21,360
when it cut the DNA into various

5505
04:59:21,360 --> 04:59:24,320
fragments then scientist realize what is

5506
04:59:24,320 --> 04:59:27,440
this why we have some enzyme which cut

5507
04:59:27,440 --> 04:59:29,160
the DN into fragment and that to its

5508
04:59:29,160 --> 04:59:31,718
specific places how it is possible then

5509
04:59:31,718 --> 04:59:34,440
scientists they extracted those enzymes

5510
04:59:34,440 --> 04:59:36,400
and he they called they named it as

5511
04:59:36,400 --> 04:59:38,240
restriction

5512
04:59:38,240 --> 04:59:40,600
endonuclease growth restrict the

5513
04:59:40,600 --> 04:59:42,958
insertion of any foreign DNA into the

5514
04:59:42,958 --> 04:59:46,200
host cell so they took it and today we

5515
04:59:46,200 --> 04:59:47,958
have the Restriction endon nucleus with

5516
04:59:47,958 --> 04:59:49,520
us

5517
04:59:49,520 --> 04:59:52,360
now why it is not cutting the own DNA

5518
04:59:52,360 --> 04:59:54,760
because of methylation because their own

5519
04:59:54,760 --> 04:59:58,080
DNA is methylated that is the

5520
04:59:58,080 --> 05:00:00,558
reason

5521
05:00:00,558 --> 05:00:03,878
okay now principle it recognize a

5522
05:00:03,878 --> 05:00:06,320
specific palindromic nucleotide sequence

5523
05:00:06,320 --> 05:00:09,558
in the DNA cut each of the two stranded

5524
05:00:09,558 --> 05:00:11,400
of the double helix at a specific

5525
05:00:11,400 --> 05:00:13,680
position in a sugar Fox phosphate back

5526
05:00:13,680 --> 05:00:16,120
background is say from this point many

5527
05:00:16,120 --> 05:00:18,878
question can be

5528
05:00:19,520 --> 05:00:24,200
asked right now it recognize a specific

5529
05:00:24,200 --> 05:00:25,638
palindromic sequence what is a

5530
05:00:25,638 --> 05:00:27,240
palindromic sequence palindromic

5531
05:00:27,240 --> 05:00:30,080
sequence is a repeat sequence repeat

5532
05:00:30,080 --> 05:00:32,240
sequence either you read it from this

5533
05:00:32,240 --> 05:00:34,120
side three prime to five prime or 5 Prim

5534
05:00:34,120 --> 05:00:35,760
to three prime it gives us same

5535
05:00:35,760 --> 05:00:41,638
information for example let's take g a a

5536
05:00:41,638 --> 05:00:50,360
t t c c t t a a g now everyone read it

5537
05:00:50,360 --> 05:00:53,920
they GA AA GA AA same so this is a

5538
05:00:53,920 --> 05:00:56,040
palindromic sequence so they recognize

5539
05:00:56,040 --> 05:00:59,400
the pelic sequence very nice malum

5540
05:00:59,400 --> 05:01:02,280
another example it he was there in my

5541
05:01:02,280 --> 05:01:06,638
class so I remember it name right

5542
05:01:06,638 --> 05:01:10,360
Madam Madam yes any other example you

5543
05:01:10,360 --> 05:01:13,798
have Madam

5544
05:01:16,320 --> 05:01:19,280
madm clear so these are the palindromic

5545
05:01:19,280 --> 05:01:22,920
sequences now they cut each of the two

5546
05:01:22,920 --> 05:01:25,760
strands of a double helix so it if

5547
05:01:25,760 --> 05:01:28,320
restriction enzyme I will add over here

5548
05:01:28,320 --> 05:01:30,360
now this restriction enzyme will cut

5549
05:01:30,360 --> 05:01:33,360
here and it will cut here also

5550
05:01:33,360 --> 05:01:36,480
so both the Strand at cut at the both

5551
05:01:36,480 --> 05:01:38,240
the Strand second most important point

5552
05:01:38,240 --> 05:01:41,280
you have to note down at specific point

5553
05:01:41,280 --> 05:01:43,878
at their sugar phosphate backbone can be

5554
05:01:43,878 --> 05:01:46,200
asked in a one marker where does it cut

5555
05:01:46,200 --> 05:01:49,400
it cut at sugar phosphate

5556
05:01:49,400 --> 05:01:53,040
backbone clear now used in genetic

5557
05:01:53,040 --> 05:01:57,958
engineering for the recombinant DNA

5558
05:01:57,958 --> 05:02:01,200
molecules also called as molecular

5559
05:02:01,200 --> 05:02:04,840
because it cuts the molecule molecular

5560
05:02:04,840 --> 05:02:08,440
Caesar discovered in 1963 as discussed

5561
05:02:08,440 --> 05:02:11,958
earlier 72 May first recombinant DNA

5562
05:02:11,958 --> 05:02:15,680
molecule was formed all thanks to this

5563
05:02:15,680 --> 05:02:17,680
1963 because we discovered this

5564
05:02:17,680 --> 05:02:19,400
restriction

5565
05:02:19,400 --> 05:02:22,000
endonucleases now let's talk about the

5566
05:02:22,000 --> 05:02:25,320
fact I'll discuss this later first types

5567
05:02:25,320 --> 05:02:29,280
it has two type exonucleases

5568
05:02:32,840 --> 05:02:35,280
nucleotide from the

5569
05:02:35,280 --> 05:02:38,680
end now suppose this is a DNA I'll take

5570
05:02:38,680 --> 05:02:41,320
a Caesar and I'll cut it like

5571
05:02:41,320 --> 05:02:44,680
this cut it like this from the end so

5572
05:02:44,680 --> 05:02:48,480
this is termed as Exon nucleus if it cut

5573
05:02:48,480 --> 05:02:52,080
in between this is endon nucleus remove

5574
05:02:52,080 --> 05:02:54,840
nucleotide from the end of DNA make cut

5575
05:02:54,840 --> 05:02:57,280
at the specific position within the DNA

5576
05:02:57,280 --> 05:02:59,920
hind 2 was the first dition endon

5577
05:02:59,920 --> 05:03:01,680
nucleus which was

5578
05:03:01,680 --> 05:03:05,958
discovered done clear everyone okay now

5579
05:03:05,958 --> 05:03:08,040
splicing produce overhanging stretching

5580
05:03:08,040 --> 05:03:10,440
called as sticky ends which facilitate

5581
05:03:10,440 --> 05:03:12,638
the action of DNA liase now let's

5582
05:03:12,638 --> 05:03:15,718
understand this what am I talking about

5583
05:03:15,718 --> 05:03:19,600
here okay this is a DNA and this is

5584
05:03:19,600 --> 05:03:22,840
another DNA I want to attach both of

5585
05:03:22,840 --> 05:03:25,320
them see what happens is this is a

5586
05:03:25,320 --> 05:03:29,200
vector DNA Vector plasma DNA right and

5587
05:03:29,200 --> 05:03:32,120
here only linear fragment is shown not

5588
05:03:32,120 --> 05:03:35,280
the circular one just think now it is

5589
05:03:35,280 --> 05:03:38,240
having a sequence of GA TTC this is a

5590
05:03:38,240 --> 05:03:40,160
palindromic sequence now what will

5591
05:03:40,160 --> 05:03:41,878
happen the enzyme will come and enzyme

5592
05:03:41,878 --> 05:03:43,760
will cut it if I add enzyme enzyme will

5593
05:03:43,760 --> 05:03:45,958
come here we are talking about one

5594
05:03:45,958 --> 05:03:48,440
enzyme which is the Eco R1 that is

5595
05:03:48,440 --> 05:03:51,680
another one so Eco R1 will come and it

5596
05:03:51,680 --> 05:03:53,200
will cut

5597
05:03:53,200 --> 05:03:56,400
here it will cut here in between the G

5598
05:03:56,400 --> 05:03:59,878
and a where does it cut sugar phosphate

5599
05:03:59,878 --> 05:04:03,120
backbone sugar phosphate backbone

5600
05:04:03,120 --> 05:04:05,558
what I will get is see here we have a

5601
05:04:05,558 --> 05:04:07,520
double standard and then a overhanging

5602
05:04:07,520 --> 05:04:10,000
sticky ends overhanging sequence now

5603
05:04:10,000 --> 05:04:13,240
this overhanging sequence can easily

5604
05:04:13,240 --> 05:04:14,520
find the something which is

5605
05:04:14,520 --> 05:04:17,798
complimentary to it isn't it if they

5606
05:04:17,798 --> 05:04:22,120
will find in the medium some a a TS

5607
05:04:22,120 --> 05:04:24,360
there they can easily go and easily bind

5608
05:04:24,360 --> 05:04:26,600
so this is the characteristic feature we

5609
05:04:26,600 --> 05:04:28,920
always go with a sticky and type of

5610
05:04:28,920 --> 05:04:30,840
those which produce sticky and type of

5611
05:04:30,840 --> 05:04:33,080
restriction enzyme we press prefer to

5612
05:04:33,080 --> 05:04:36,360
use that we do not use the one which

5613
05:04:36,360 --> 05:04:39,440
produces the blunt end blunt end means

5614
05:04:39,440 --> 05:04:44,798
cut straight no we always use this

5615
05:04:44,798 --> 05:04:46,718
similarly the same type of thetion

5616
05:04:46,718 --> 05:04:50,200
enzyme will be used in the DNA isolation

5617
05:04:50,200 --> 05:04:52,160
so here same will be used same type of

5618
05:04:52,160 --> 05:04:54,480
sticky EDS will be produced now they are

5619
05:04:54,480 --> 05:04:56,040
complimentary to each other they can

5620
05:04:56,040 --> 05:04:58,080
fall in love with each other and what we

5621
05:04:58,080 --> 05:05:01,400
can get is a recombinant DNA so sticky

5622
05:05:01,400 --> 05:05:04,480
end one is you

5623
05:05:04,718 --> 05:05:08,080
used yes so always when you will be

5624
05:05:08,080 --> 05:05:10,200
doing biotechnology experiment in your

5625
05:05:10,200 --> 05:05:13,280
laboratory make sure at that particular

5626
05:05:13,280 --> 05:05:15,638
time you should use the same restriction

5627
05:05:15,638 --> 05:05:18,680
endon nucleus one while isolating the

5628
05:05:18,680 --> 05:05:21,760
DNA and second for the

5629
05:05:21,760 --> 05:05:25,400
vector okay

5630
05:05:25,400 --> 05:05:27,878
now let's talk about now tools of

5631
05:05:27,878 --> 05:05:30,958
biotechnology First Tool we have already

5632
05:05:30,958 --> 05:05:34,000
discussed that is the restriction endon

5633
05:05:34,000 --> 05:05:36,600
nucleus polymerase enzymes for

5634
05:05:36,600 --> 05:05:39,920
replication we require some liases we

5635
05:05:39,920 --> 05:05:41,920
require some Vector we require some host

5636
05:05:41,920 --> 05:05:46,680
organism where we want to clone is

5637
05:05:47,200 --> 05:05:51,480
clear now next uh let's talk about

5638
05:05:51,480 --> 05:05:54,000
vectors one example I have already given

5639
05:05:54,000 --> 05:05:56,558
you what is that that is a plasmid let's

5640
05:05:56,558 --> 05:05:58,958
talk about other example now first one

5641
05:05:58,958 --> 05:06:02,440
cloning Vector is a DNA segment that

5642
05:06:02,440 --> 05:06:04,558
replicate independent of the chromosome

5643
05:06:04,558 --> 05:06:07,240
and can be transferred between the host

5644
05:06:07,240 --> 05:06:08,760
what is the cloning Vector cloning

5645
05:06:08,760 --> 05:06:11,000
vectors are like Vehicles they will

5646
05:06:11,000 --> 05:06:13,000
carry your DNA whatever you want to give

5647
05:06:13,000 --> 05:06:14,878
them they will carry that and they will

5648
05:06:14,878 --> 05:06:17,240
transfer to a particular location they

5649
05:06:17,240 --> 05:06:18,840
are like a

5650
05:06:18,840 --> 05:06:21,440
Vehicles similarly here the examples are

5651
05:06:21,440 --> 05:06:24,080
given as plasmids and bacteriophage not

5652
05:06:24,080 --> 05:06:26,718
only the plasmid and bacterio we have an

5653
05:06:26,718 --> 05:06:29,440
example of the

5654
05:06:29,440 --> 05:06:33,160
back we have an example of yak

5655
05:06:33,160 --> 05:06:36,160
we have an example of TI

5656
05:06:36,160 --> 05:06:40,360
plasmid we have an example of

5657
05:06:42,240 --> 05:06:44,400
retrovirus

5658
05:06:44,400 --> 05:06:47,400
retrovirus

5659
05:06:47,480 --> 05:06:53,040
fade F mid we have an example of for

5660
05:06:53,878 --> 05:06:58,360
cosmids these are the various examples C

5661
05:06:58,360 --> 05:07:01,240
bacterio phase because their High copy

5662
05:07:01,240 --> 05:07:03,958
number per cell have a high copy number

5663
05:07:03,958 --> 05:07:05,480
of the genome within the bacterial cell

5664
05:07:05,480 --> 05:07:08,000
the bacterial FES they are also

5665
05:07:08,000 --> 05:07:11,200
used clear now one more

5666
05:07:11,200 --> 05:07:14,638
thing we talked about the hind two so

5667
05:07:14,638 --> 05:07:16,840
there are some other examples Also let's

5668
05:07:16,840 --> 05:07:18,240
talk about

5669
05:07:18,240 --> 05:07:21,280
them we have restriction uh other

5670
05:07:21,280 --> 05:07:24,240
restriction enzymes like Eco

5671
05:07:24,240 --> 05:07:27,600
R1 we have an example of hind

5672
05:07:27,600 --> 05:07:31,320
2 we have an example of hind

5673
05:07:31,320 --> 05:07:35,878
3 we have an example of bam

5674
05:07:35,878 --> 05:07:37,958
H1 bam

5675
05:07:37,958 --> 05:07:44,360
H1 pvu one we have an example of

5676
05:07:46,440 --> 05:07:49,638
pst1 too many examples are there but how

5677
05:07:49,638 --> 05:07:52,638
their naming was done let's have a look

5678
05:07:52,638 --> 05:07:55,718
if I talk about

5679
05:07:56,200 --> 05:08:01,200
E1 what is e what is e buddies e is

5680
05:08:01,200 --> 05:08:02,878
esta

5681
05:08:02,878 --> 05:08:06,440
e come from the

5682
05:08:06,638 --> 05:08:10,040
first genus first letter

5683
05:08:10,040 --> 05:08:15,160
esteria two comes from Ki two words from

5684
05:08:15,160 --> 05:08:18,760
Ki one word from genus two from Ki me

5685
05:08:18,760 --> 05:08:25,718
the species R come from The Strain R

5686
05:08:25,718 --> 05:08:31,200
strain one comes from the sequence of

5687
05:08:31,200 --> 05:08:34,200
isolation

5688
05:08:37,240 --> 05:08:40,280
sequence in which it is

5689
05:08:41,360 --> 05:08:44,520
isolated okay

5690
05:08:44,520 --> 05:08:46,760
clear so like this we have a various

5691
05:08:46,760 --> 05:08:51,120
example hemophilus influenza the uh what

5692
05:08:51,120 --> 05:08:54,600
was this this Amo liquifan is there so

5693
05:08:54,600 --> 05:08:57,958
many examples are there

5694
05:08:58,120 --> 05:09:01,680
aluan now vectors features of cloning

5695
05:09:01,680 --> 05:09:03,840
vectors there are two different features

5696
05:09:03,840 --> 05:09:06,480
of cloning Vector

5697
05:09:06,480 --> 05:09:09,320
yes cloning site so they should have a

5698
05:09:09,320 --> 05:09:12,120
cloning site they should have a cloning

5699
05:09:12,120 --> 05:09:13,520
site I'll show

5700
05:09:13,520 --> 05:09:17,480
you cloning site guys can you see can

5701
05:09:17,480 --> 05:09:20,558
you spot here any cloning site anyone

5702
05:09:20,558 --> 05:09:23,798
come on Can you spot some cloning sites

5703
05:09:23,798 --> 05:09:25,878
here in this plasmid this is a vector

5704
05:09:25,878 --> 05:09:28,320
this is an example this is artificially

5705
05:09:28,320 --> 05:09:32,120
synthesized uh vector by Boliver Rodrigo

5706
05:09:32,120 --> 05:09:35,000
who ask can you tell

5707
05:09:35,000 --> 05:09:37,400
me

5708
05:09:37,400 --> 05:09:39,760
rope not

5709
05:09:39,760 --> 05:09:43,718
rope cloning sites where can we

5710
05:09:43,718 --> 05:09:47,638
clone yes this is PBR 322 come

5711
05:09:47,638 --> 05:09:51,840
on no no no no

5712
05:09:54,480 --> 05:09:57,000
rope guys can you

5713
05:09:57,000 --> 05:10:00,160
see if restriction enzyme will come here

5714
05:10:00,160 --> 05:10:03,520
so here only the DNA will come and

5715
05:10:03,520 --> 05:10:07,920
insert no Sami

5716
05:10:08,200 --> 05:10:11,200
no if DNA will come over here these are

5717
05:10:11,200 --> 05:10:13,520
the cloning site if e R1 I'm using e R1

5718
05:10:13,520 --> 05:10:15,718
will come and cut here and DNA will come

5719
05:10:15,718 --> 05:10:17,638
at this position if I use clav one clav

5720
05:10:17,638 --> 05:10:19,520
one come and cut here I will insert the

5721
05:10:19,520 --> 05:10:22,718
DNA this location pv1 will cut here the

5722
05:10:22,718 --> 05:10:24,718
BAM H1 will cut

5723
05:10:24,718 --> 05:10:28,160
here isn't

5724
05:10:30,760 --> 05:10:33,440
it okay

5725
05:10:33,440 --> 05:10:37,600
now so few or single recognition site

5726
05:10:37,600 --> 05:10:40,160
for restriction enzymes are used these

5727
05:10:40,160 --> 05:10:41,638
are the cloning

5728
05:10:41,638 --> 05:10:44,920
sites is this

5729
05:10:44,920 --> 05:10:48,120
clear M Class 11th

5730
05:10:48,120 --> 05:10:50,040
ma

5731
05:10:50,040 --> 05:10:53,680
okay I'll teach you

5732
05:10:53,840 --> 05:10:55,680
mathematics we have classes of

5733
05:10:55,680 --> 05:10:57,798
mathematics also you can follow

5734
05:10:57,798 --> 05:11:00,320
them if I'll teach you mathematics then

5735
05:11:00,320 --> 05:11:03,958
you you will hate

5736
05:11:04,760 --> 05:11:08,040
mathematics okay isika now vors of

5737
05:11:08,040 --> 05:11:10,680
cloning genes in a plants and animals

5738
05:11:10,680 --> 05:11:12,840
for example plasmids of agrobacterium

5739
05:11:12,840 --> 05:11:15,840
tum retrovirus if you are using plants

5740
05:11:15,840 --> 05:11:18,200
if you have to do transf if you have to

5741
05:11:18,200 --> 05:11:20,040
do the transfer in Plants the DNA

5742
05:11:20,040 --> 05:11:21,760
transfer in Plants you will use the ti

5743
05:11:21,760 --> 05:11:26,080
plasmid of retr uh agrobacterium tuation

5744
05:11:26,080 --> 05:11:27,680
but if you have to use a animal if you

5745
05:11:27,680 --> 05:11:29,440
have to use a human make if you have to

5746
05:11:29,440 --> 05:11:32,718
do this in human or animal

5747
05:11:32,718 --> 05:11:35,040
anything then in that case you will use

5748
05:11:35,040 --> 05:11:37,280
the

5749
05:11:41,520 --> 05:11:44,718
retrovirus now next one origin of

5750
05:11:44,718 --> 05:11:47,160
replication or should have origin of

5751
05:11:47,160 --> 05:11:48,638
replication what is the origin of

5752
05:11:48,638 --> 05:11:50,600
replication origin of replication is

5753
05:11:50,600 --> 05:11:55,240
that place where the replication start

5754
05:11:56,240 --> 05:11:59,240
Ori

5755
05:11:59,360 --> 05:12:03,920
okay next is selectable mark Mar marker

5756
05:12:03,920 --> 05:12:05,920
so selectable markers are those marker

5757
05:12:05,920 --> 05:12:07,718
which helps in identifying the

5758
05:12:07,718 --> 05:12:09,798
transformants and non-

5759
05:12:09,798 --> 05:12:12,160
transformant transformants and non-

5760
05:12:12,160 --> 05:12:15,878
transformant so let's complete

5761
05:12:22,240 --> 05:12:25,958
this right

5762
05:12:25,958 --> 05:12:29,320
so now here let's have a

5763
05:12:29,320 --> 05:12:32,320
look now suppose now now listen very

5764
05:12:32,320 --> 05:12:34,480
carefully now suppose I have inserted a

5765
05:12:34,480 --> 05:12:37,958
gene over here which Gene is affected

5766
05:12:37,958 --> 05:12:40,480
ampicilin resistant so that means

5767
05:12:40,480 --> 05:12:42,840
transformant will not be ampicilin

5768
05:12:42,840 --> 05:12:44,920
resistant transformant will not be

5769
05:12:44,920 --> 05:12:49,600
ampicilin resistant if I'll use a bam H1

5770
05:12:49,600 --> 05:12:52,440
over here right tetracyclin resistance

5771
05:12:52,440 --> 05:12:54,320
Gene will be affected that means our

5772
05:12:54,320 --> 05:12:56,878
transformant our new synthesized

5773
05:12:56,878 --> 05:12:59,638
recombinant DNA will not be tetracycline

5774
05:12:59,638 --> 05:13:02,798
resistant is this point clear yes so

5775
05:13:02,798 --> 05:13:05,638
these are the selectable markers so

5776
05:13:05,638 --> 05:13:08,520
selectable markers how can we select on

5777
05:13:08,520 --> 05:13:10,080
the basis of the

5778
05:13:10,080 --> 05:13:13,080
first

5779
05:13:14,200 --> 05:13:17,200
selectable

5780
05:13:18,120 --> 05:13:21,958
markers selectable markers are important

5781
05:13:21,958 --> 05:13:24,958
in selection between the recombinant and

5782
05:13:24,958 --> 05:13:27,240
non-

5783
05:13:29,160 --> 05:13:33,760
recombinant and non

5784
05:13:37,798 --> 05:13:39,638
recombinant recombinant and non-

5785
05:13:39,638 --> 05:13:43,000
recomment now listen very carefully

5786
05:13:43,000 --> 05:13:47,638
if if p v

5787
05:13:47,638 --> 05:13:50,080
U1 we are

5788
05:13:50,080 --> 05:13:54,120
used PV U1 we have used if we have used

5789
05:13:54,120 --> 05:13:58,798
pv1 so pv1 if we have used then

5790
05:13:58,798 --> 05:14:04,878
meline resistance G being

5791
05:14:05,680 --> 05:14:09,080
disrupted this is disrupted if this is

5792
05:14:09,080 --> 05:14:14,920
disrupted then your transformant or the

5793
05:14:18,638 --> 05:14:20,760
recombinant

5794
05:14:20,760 --> 05:14:24,120
will not

5795
05:14:24,120 --> 05:14:28,320
be ampicilline

5796
05:14:30,680 --> 05:14:33,680
resistant

5797
05:14:35,600 --> 05:14:38,080
now what are these recombinant and wrong

5798
05:14:38,080 --> 05:14:40,160
recombinant means new combination that

5799
05:14:40,160 --> 05:14:42,120
means I have inserted DNA non-

5800
05:14:42,120 --> 05:14:44,040
recombinant means I have not inserted

5801
05:14:44,040 --> 05:14:46,160
the

5802
05:14:46,320 --> 05:14:49,360
DNA right recombinate I have inserted

5803
05:14:49,360 --> 05:14:51,160
the DNA I have not inserted the DNA this

5804
05:14:51,160 --> 05:14:54,000
is the difference between these two

5805
05:14:54,000 --> 05:14:57,120
okay clear now moving on to the next

5806
05:14:57,120 --> 05:15:00,360
similarly there's another way also by

5807
05:15:00,360 --> 05:15:03,600
producing colored colony

5808
05:15:05,878 --> 05:15:08,718
by

5809
05:15:08,718 --> 05:15:13,080
producing colored

5810
05:15:13,760 --> 05:15:16,718
Colony colored

5811
05:15:16,718 --> 05:15:21,520
Colony suppose here there is a enzyme

5812
05:15:21,520 --> 05:15:23,040
there is a

5813
05:15:23,040 --> 05:15:25,840
gene which code for

5814
05:15:25,840 --> 05:15:30,080
beta Galo

5815
05:15:30,558 --> 05:15:32,120
cides

5816
05:15:32,120 --> 05:15:36,400
beta galacto so let's say not

5817
05:15:37,638 --> 05:15:39,920
here let's say

5818
05:15:39,920 --> 05:15:44,120
here I have a gene Gene which code for

5819
05:15:44,120 --> 05:15:47,480
beta galactosidase

5820
05:15:47,480 --> 05:15:49,920
enzyme beta

5821
05:15:49,920 --> 05:15:52,920
galactosidase

5822
05:15:53,878 --> 05:15:58,040
enzyme beta galois enzy okay now listen

5823
05:15:58,040 --> 05:16:00,520
very carefully very very very

5824
05:16:00,520 --> 05:16:02,638
carefully

5825
05:16:02,638 --> 05:16:10,760
if if Sal one can you see Sal one enzyme

5826
05:16:10,760 --> 05:16:14,000
used enzyme

5827
05:16:14,000 --> 05:16:15,840
used

5828
05:16:15,840 --> 05:16:18,840
then

5829
05:16:20,718 --> 05:16:25,080
recombinant will not be able to

5830
05:16:27,320 --> 05:16:30,480
produce will not be able to

5831
05:16:30,480 --> 05:16:32,400
produce

5832
05:16:32,400 --> 05:16:35,400
beta

5833
05:16:37,320 --> 05:16:39,480
galactosides beta

5834
05:16:39,480 --> 05:16:42,040
galactosides right

5835
05:16:42,040 --> 05:16:47,200
now if I add chromogenic

5836
05:16:49,520 --> 05:16:53,480
substrate chromogenic

5837
05:16:53,520 --> 05:16:58,200
substrate no beta galto side is so White

5838
05:16:58,200 --> 05:17:00,400
colony White

5839
05:17:00,400 --> 05:17:02,120
colony

5840
05:17:02,120 --> 05:17:03,718
White

5841
05:17:03,718 --> 05:17:08,000
colony clear now suppose beta galoes is

5842
05:17:08,000 --> 05:17:11,718
there this beta gyas is there now when

5843
05:17:11,718 --> 05:17:14,400
beta gidas is there chromogenic

5844
05:17:14,400 --> 05:17:18,280
substrate when I add any substrate color

5845
05:17:18,280 --> 05:17:22,200
producing which is specific to Beta

5846
05:17:22,200 --> 05:17:24,798
galactosides

5847
05:17:24,798 --> 05:17:30,280
substrate I'll add with the beta

5848
05:17:30,400 --> 05:17:33,400
galoes

5849
05:17:33,520 --> 05:17:38,120
with beta galosy is produce a Blue

5850
05:17:38,120 --> 05:17:42,280
Colony up by looking at them now it's

5851
05:17:42,280 --> 05:17:45,798
like now it is like the major thing

5852
05:17:45,798 --> 05:17:49,680
is listen very

5853
05:17:50,440 --> 05:17:53,920
carefully now

5854
05:17:54,000 --> 05:17:57,878
listen I have a a solution I have a

5855
05:17:57,878 --> 05:18:00,040
solution right in that I have added

5856
05:18:00,040 --> 05:18:02,040
plasmid I have ADD added restriction

5857
05:18:02,040 --> 05:18:03,920
endon nucleus and I have added my Gene

5858
05:18:03,920 --> 05:18:06,878
of Interest also in all the plasmid my

5859
05:18:06,878 --> 05:18:09,200
DNA will not go and insert if my DNA

5860
05:18:09,200 --> 05:18:11,000
will insert that will be a recombinant

5861
05:18:11,000 --> 05:18:13,080
plasmid if my DNA will not insert that

5862
05:18:13,080 --> 05:18:15,080
will be a non-recombinant plasmid how

5863
05:18:15,080 --> 05:18:16,520
will I recognize whether this is a

5864
05:18:16,520 --> 05:18:18,360
recombinant plaset or non-recombinant

5865
05:18:18,360 --> 05:18:21,558
plaset first what will I do is in that

5866
05:18:21,558 --> 05:18:23,840
culture medium in that thing what will I

5867
05:18:23,840 --> 05:18:26,798
do I will add the chromogenic substrate

5868
05:18:26,798 --> 05:18:29,040
if they will produce the color so that

5869
05:18:29,040 --> 05:18:31,360
means they are non-recombinant if they

5870
05:18:31,360 --> 05:18:34,680
will not they will uh not produce the

5871
05:18:34,680 --> 05:18:37,080
color so that means the beta

5872
05:18:37,080 --> 05:18:39,400
galactosidase Gene is affected because

5873
05:18:39,400 --> 05:18:41,920
my Gene my Gene has been inserted here

5874
05:18:41,920 --> 05:18:44,718
at the salvan

5875
05:18:45,320 --> 05:18:48,080
position right is this point clear to

5876
05:18:48,080 --> 05:18:51,760
all of you yes come on tell

5877
05:18:52,480 --> 05:18:56,360
me come on come on tell

5878
05:18:58,638 --> 05:19:03,240
me come on

5879
05:19:21,798 --> 05:19:24,040
very

5880
05:19:24,040 --> 05:19:29,120
nice arnest AA this Ernest Hackle was

5881
05:19:29,120 --> 05:19:31,718
the one who introduced the term ecology

5882
05:19:31,718 --> 05:19:34,080
he's not a father he's not a

5883
05:19:34,080 --> 05:19:36,638
father humbold is a father he's not a

5884
05:19:36,638 --> 05:19:38,400
father okay just do not be confused

5885
05:19:38,400 --> 05:19:40,240
between Ernest Heckle he was the first

5886
05:19:40,240 --> 05:19:43,360
one who introduced the word

5887
05:19:44,000 --> 05:19:47,080
ecology this is a class 12th buddies one

5888
05:19:47,080 --> 05:19:49,480
shot going on for the board examination

5889
05:19:49,480 --> 05:19:51,718
here I'm not I'm sorry I'm not here I'm

5890
05:19:51,718 --> 05:19:54,440
teaching hemic cardates and any other

5891
05:19:54,440 --> 05:19:57,440
thing

5892
05:20:00,160 --> 05:20:02,140
clear

5893
05:20:02,140 --> 05:20:05,189
[Music]

5894
05:20:06,840 --> 05:20:09,760
Survival let's not focus here let's come

5895
05:20:09,760 --> 05:20:13,160
back okay now let's come back so these

5896
05:20:13,160 --> 05:20:14,600
are the two ways by which we can

5897
05:20:14,600 --> 05:20:16,360
recognize one by the selectable marker

5898
05:20:16,360 --> 05:20:18,200
and second by producing the chromogenic

5899
05:20:18,200 --> 05:20:20,280
substrate hope this points are clear

5900
05:20:20,280 --> 05:20:24,480
okay now moving on to the next

5901
05:20:27,200 --> 05:20:30,878
is competent hold first now let's talk

5902
05:20:30,878 --> 05:20:32,680
about the process of recombinant DNA

5903
05:20:32,680 --> 05:20:34,320
technology what is the actual process of

5904
05:20:34,320 --> 05:20:35,840
recombinant DNA technology let's have a

5905
05:20:35,840 --> 05:20:37,878
look now first thing what we are going

5906
05:20:37,878 --> 05:20:40,240
to do is isolation of genetic material

5907
05:20:40,240 --> 05:20:41,878
first we will isolate the genetic

5908
05:20:41,878 --> 05:20:44,878
material now listen very carefully I

5909
05:20:44,878 --> 05:20:48,400
have a cell it is having a DNA it is

5910
05:20:48,400 --> 05:20:50,120
having other substances also but I have

5911
05:20:50,120 --> 05:20:53,600
to isolate only DNA so for this what

5912
05:20:53,600 --> 05:20:56,840
will I do is I will use various enzymes

5913
05:20:56,840 --> 05:20:59,638
right if I'm using plant

5914
05:20:59,638 --> 05:21:02,798
cell plant cell to break the plant cell

5915
05:21:02,798 --> 05:21:04,878
I will use

5916
05:21:04,878 --> 05:21:08,718
cellules I will use cellules if I'm

5917
05:21:08,718 --> 05:21:12,680
using let's say

5918
05:21:12,878 --> 05:21:16,440
fungus fungus cell I will

5919
05:21:16,440 --> 05:21:21,080
use uh uh

5920
05:21:22,520 --> 05:21:26,958
kitenin if I'm using bacterial

5921
05:21:26,958 --> 05:21:33,040
cell bacterial cell I will use lysine

5922
05:21:35,520 --> 05:21:38,798
clear right I don't want my proteins

5923
05:21:38,798 --> 05:21:40,558
should be there because what I want is

5924
05:21:40,558 --> 05:21:42,958
only DNA protein will be digested by

5925
05:21:42,958 --> 05:21:44,958
protein

5926
05:21:44,958 --> 05:21:48,280
proteas I don't want RNA should be

5927
05:21:48,280 --> 05:21:52,320
there I will digest the RNA by

5928
05:21:52,320 --> 05:21:56,080
rnas what I will get is only DNA what I

5929
05:21:56,080 --> 05:21:59,920
will get is only DNA isn't it this is

5930
05:21:59,920 --> 05:22:01,480
what we want

5931
05:22:01,480 --> 05:22:05,840
next is I will get 2.2 M

5932
05:22:05,840 --> 05:22:10,080
DNA if I talk about human body 2.2 M

5933
05:22:10,080 --> 05:22:13,000
long DNA is there but I want only a

5934
05:22:13,000 --> 05:22:16,600
specific sequence so in that case I will

5935
05:22:16,600 --> 05:22:18,558
use enzyme which is restriction

5936
05:22:18,558 --> 05:22:21,958
endonuclease suppose

5937
05:22:22,638 --> 05:22:26,360
one because I know at this particular

5938
05:22:26,360 --> 05:22:28,920
location my Gene is there and beside

5939
05:22:28,920 --> 05:22:31,558
this Gene I have this restriction enzyme

5940
05:22:31,558 --> 05:22:34,760
position so I will use that restriction

5941
05:22:34,760 --> 05:22:37,480
enzyme now the next thing is I will

5942
05:22:37,480 --> 05:22:39,958
isolate and separate the DNA fragment

5943
05:22:39,958 --> 05:22:42,200
how am I going to isolate and separate

5944
05:22:42,200 --> 05:22:44,600
the DNA fragment I'm going to do that

5945
05:22:44,600 --> 05:22:47,638
with the help of a gel

5946
05:22:50,400 --> 05:22:53,680
electroforesis gel

5947
05:22:53,680 --> 05:22:55,958
electroforesis now listen again very

5948
05:22:55,958 --> 05:22:58,680
carefully what was I having I was having

5949
05:22:58,680 --> 05:23:01,600
2.2 m

5950
05:23:01,600 --> 05:23:06,360
DNA I isolated this in two

5951
05:23:07,600 --> 05:23:09,958
fragments how can I recognize that this

5952
05:23:09,958 --> 05:23:11,920
one is mine this is the one which I am

5953
05:23:11,920 --> 05:23:14,280
looking for how can I do that I will do

5954
05:23:14,280 --> 05:23:15,280
that with the help of a gel

5955
05:23:15,280 --> 05:23:17,120
electroforesis now what actually a gel

5956
05:23:17,120 --> 05:23:20,600
electroforesis is let's have a

5957
05:23:23,480 --> 05:23:25,480
look

5958
05:23:25,480 --> 05:23:28,480
gel

5959
05:23:29,878 --> 05:23:32,878
electroforesis

5960
05:23:33,000 --> 05:23:35,080
what is gel electroforesis gel

5961
05:23:35,080 --> 05:23:39,558
electroforesis is the process of

5962
05:23:40,558 --> 05:23:42,718
separation process

5963
05:23:42,718 --> 05:23:45,718
of

5964
05:23:45,840 --> 05:23:49,600
separation of DNA

5965
05:23:50,520 --> 05:23:52,878
fragments

5966
05:23:52,878 --> 05:23:55,878
DNA

5967
05:23:56,040 --> 05:23:57,840
fragments

5968
05:23:57,840 --> 05:24:02,798
fragments on the basis of

5969
05:24:08,400 --> 05:24:11,240
charge and

5970
05:24:11,240 --> 05:24:13,920
size what kind of charge is there what

5971
05:24:13,920 --> 05:24:16,400
kind of size is there on that basis I

5972
05:24:16,400 --> 05:24:18,878
will isolate them gel

5973
05:24:18,878 --> 05:24:22,080
electroforesis now what will I do see

5974
05:24:22,080 --> 05:24:24,320
gel

5975
05:24:24,320 --> 05:24:26,920
electroforesis now first thing is I will

5976
05:24:26,920 --> 05:24:29,760
use a agros

5977
05:24:29,760 --> 05:24:32,760
gel

5978
05:24:35,440 --> 05:24:39,080
I have this agrose

5979
05:24:39,520 --> 05:24:43,558
gel egg Rose gel now this egg Rose

5980
05:24:43,558 --> 05:24:46,878
gel we have a it's isolated from a wheat

5981
05:24:46,878 --> 05:24:49,798
agros wheat and from that we prepare a

5982
05:24:49,798 --> 05:24:53,120
gel right it is solid normally it's

5983
05:24:53,120 --> 05:24:54,920
available in the laboratory and it is

5984
05:24:54,920 --> 05:24:56,958
solid and we have to add a buffer and

5985
05:24:56,958 --> 05:24:59,600
accordingly we can set it we set this in

5986
05:24:59,600 --> 05:25:02,200
a this in this particular way that here

5987
05:25:02,200 --> 05:25:04,718
there are

5988
05:25:05,638 --> 05:25:08,360
Wells Wells we create Wells with the

5989
05:25:08,360 --> 05:25:10,240
help of a com just like that a normal

5990
05:25:10,240 --> 05:25:12,320
comb we use so for this we have another

5991
05:25:12,320 --> 05:25:15,718
comb so that create a well

5992
05:25:15,718 --> 05:25:20,280
well now what we do is we with the help

5993
05:25:20,280 --> 05:25:22,120
of a micro

5994
05:25:22,120 --> 05:25:26,120
pipet we insert our DNA

5995
05:25:26,120 --> 05:25:29,400
here we will insert our DNA here right

5996
05:25:29,400 --> 05:25:32,320
we will keep inserting the the DNA right

5997
05:25:32,320 --> 05:25:35,120
we will keep everything whatever we have

5998
05:25:35,120 --> 05:25:39,240
in a buffer

5999
05:25:40,718 --> 05:25:44,600
solution this is a buffer

6000
05:25:44,600 --> 05:25:47,600
solution

6001
05:25:47,798 --> 05:25:50,840
buffer inside there is a buffer and this

6002
05:25:50,840 --> 05:25:53,160
is

6003
05:25:53,520 --> 05:25:56,840
Electro for

6004
05:25:56,840 --> 05:25:59,600
ftic

6005
05:25:59,600 --> 05:26:01,920
unit

6006
05:26:01,920 --> 05:26:05,160
electrophoric unit right now next is we

6007
05:26:05,160 --> 05:26:07,320
are going to attach

6008
05:26:07,320 --> 05:26:10,480
this next is we are going to attach this

6009
05:26:10,480 --> 05:26:12,878
to

6010
05:26:13,600 --> 05:26:17,958
electricity e I'm labeling as

6011
05:26:18,840 --> 05:26:21,000
electricity right electricity is

6012
05:26:21,000 --> 05:26:23,280
attached you all know what is the charge

6013
05:26:23,280 --> 05:26:24,080
of

6014
05:26:24,080 --> 05:26:26,400
DNA what is the charge of

6015
05:26:26,400 --> 05:26:30,760
DNA DNA is negatively charged how how

6016
05:26:30,760 --> 05:26:33,480
can I say it is negatively charged

6017
05:26:33,480 --> 05:26:36,000
because of

6018
05:26:37,040 --> 05:26:40,080
phosphate because of phosphate it has

6019
05:26:40,080 --> 05:26:42,000
phosphate because of phosphate it is

6020
05:26:42,000 --> 05:26:44,718
negatively charged and as it is having

6021
05:26:44,718 --> 05:26:47,520
phosphate no stone gives histones to we

6022
05:26:47,520 --> 05:26:50,440
have removed now some hisone we have

6023
05:26:50,440 --> 05:26:52,480
already removed you remember we added

6024
05:26:52,480 --> 05:26:54,920
prot

6025
05:26:54,958 --> 05:26:57,840
proteos yes for the

6026
05:26:57,840 --> 05:26:59,520
digestion

6027
05:26:59,520 --> 05:27:01,638
no

6028
05:27:01,638 --> 05:27:04,240
DNA is negatively charged so here the

6029
05:27:04,240 --> 05:27:06,280
positive terminal is attached here

6030
05:27:06,280 --> 05:27:07,958
negative terminal is attached in this

6031
05:27:07,958 --> 05:27:10,240
way now DNA being the negatively charged

6032
05:27:10,240 --> 05:27:12,040
DNA will

6033
05:27:12,040 --> 05:27:16,080
move DNA will

6034
05:27:17,638 --> 05:27:22,680
move DNA will move okay now as it will

6035
05:27:22,680 --> 05:27:24,638
be visible it will be quite evident

6036
05:27:24,638 --> 05:27:26,680
suppose our fragment is like this this

6037
05:27:26,680 --> 05:27:29,760
is a one which we uh suppose this is

6038
05:27:29,760 --> 05:27:32,280
this is a uh this is the gel right run

6039
05:27:32,280 --> 05:27:34,320
is there everything is there now what we

6040
05:27:34,320 --> 05:27:37,600
are going to do is we step number two is

6041
05:27:37,600 --> 05:27:39,840
we will take

6042
05:27:39,840 --> 05:27:42,638
gel whole gel

6043
05:27:42,638 --> 05:27:46,240
and place it

6044
05:27:47,360 --> 05:27:48,878
in

6045
05:27:48,878 --> 05:27:51,878
UV

6046
05:27:56,600 --> 05:27:59,440
transilluminator UV trans

6047
05:27:59,440 --> 05:28:01,480
illuminator

6048
05:28:01,480 --> 05:28:04,160
ultraviolet transilluminator right we

6049
05:28:04,160 --> 05:28:07,120
will add a you know here we add a Dye

6050
05:28:07,120 --> 05:28:09,798
also we add while this making the this

6051
05:28:09,798 --> 05:28:13,878
we add dye also that is ethidium

6052
05:28:14,040 --> 05:28:17,440
bromide ethidium bromide

6053
05:28:17,440 --> 05:28:21,440
etbr so as you will place under the UV

6054
05:28:21,440 --> 05:28:22,600
trans

6055
05:28:22,600 --> 05:28:25,600
Illuminator orange deep

6056
05:28:25,600 --> 05:28:29,400
orange bands will be

6057
05:28:29,400 --> 05:28:32,400
visible

6058
05:28:35,878 --> 05:28:37,920
deep orange bands will be visible and if

6059
05:28:37,920 --> 05:28:41,000
you look at these bands if you look at

6060
05:28:41,000 --> 05:28:43,480
those bands what will you

6061
05:28:43,480 --> 05:28:46,638
see that your DNA is there right you

6062
05:28:46,638 --> 05:28:48,440
will recognize that our fragment is

6063
05:28:48,440 --> 05:28:50,920
there let's see it will be visible now

6064
05:28:50,920 --> 05:28:55,680
next step is Step number four

6065
05:28:57,080 --> 05:28:59,320
illusion we will

6066
05:28:59,320 --> 05:29:02,320
cut

6067
05:29:03,240 --> 05:29:05,558
specific

6068
05:29:05,558 --> 05:29:08,480
DNA

6069
05:29:08,480 --> 05:29:12,320
fragment we will cut DNA

6070
05:29:12,320 --> 05:29:17,558
fragment or DNA uh you know the

6071
05:29:21,160 --> 05:29:25,080
gel we will cut the gel

6072
05:29:25,080 --> 05:29:28,080
now

6073
05:29:28,558 --> 05:29:32,320
specific cut

6074
05:29:32,920 --> 05:29:35,120
specific

6075
05:29:35,120 --> 05:29:37,480
gel

6076
05:29:37,480 --> 05:29:40,480
where

6077
05:29:41,558 --> 05:29:45,840
required DNA fragment is

6078
05:29:47,760 --> 05:29:54,840
present required DNA fragment is

6079
05:29:57,200 --> 05:29:59,878
present done so this is termed as gel

6080
05:29:59,878 --> 05:30:02,400
electr fores and these are the

6081
05:30:02,400 --> 05:30:06,480
illusion now moving on to the next is

6082
05:30:06,480 --> 05:30:10,680
now done now we got our

6083
05:30:10,680 --> 05:30:14,520
DNA we got our DNA a single fragment I

6084
05:30:14,520 --> 05:30:17,760
got now without single fragment I cannot

6085
05:30:17,760 --> 05:30:19,798
proceed with the whole experiment is it

6086
05:30:19,798 --> 05:30:21,360
is that possible to proceed with that

6087
05:30:21,360 --> 05:30:23,798
experiment no right so what we are going

6088
05:30:23,798 --> 05:30:27,040
to do is we will amplify the gene of

6089
05:30:27,040 --> 05:30:29,958
Interest we will amplify the gene of

6090
05:30:29,958 --> 05:30:30,958
Interest

6091
05:30:30,958 --> 05:30:34,320
now for

6092
05:30:42,520 --> 05:30:44,440
amplification

6093
05:30:44,440 --> 05:30:47,400
amplification

6094
05:30:47,400 --> 05:30:51,680
of gene of

6095
05:30:54,000 --> 05:30:57,000
interest for amplification Gene of

6096
05:30:57,000 --> 05:30:58,920
Interest we use a machine which is

6097
05:30:58,920 --> 05:31:01,520
termed as PC

6098
05:31:01,520 --> 05:31:04,718
R what we use is we use a machine which

6099
05:31:04,718 --> 05:31:06,000
is a

6100
05:31:06,000 --> 05:31:07,920
PCR which

6101
05:31:07,920 --> 05:31:10,920
is

6102
05:31:11,520 --> 05:31:13,400
polymerase

6103
05:31:13,400 --> 05:31:16,400
Chain

6104
05:31:18,600 --> 05:31:21,798
Reaction polymerase Chain Reaction

6105
05:31:21,798 --> 05:31:23,840
polymerase chain reaction was discovered

6106
05:31:23,840 --> 05:31:27,000
by car

6107
05:31:28,958 --> 05:31:30,718
mulus now

6108
05:31:30,718 --> 05:31:33,840
now this polymerase Chain Reaction

6109
05:31:33,840 --> 05:31:36,240
amplify the DNA if I have one DNA

6110
05:31:36,240 --> 05:31:39,718
fragment now this polymer G one they

6111
05:31:39,718 --> 05:31:42,558
will amplify

6112
05:31:46,240 --> 05:31:50,200
it and the rate of

6113
05:31:52,320 --> 05:31:54,840
amplification

6114
05:31:54,840 --> 05:31:58,718
amplification is like 2 ra to power

6115
05:31:58,718 --> 05:32:04,080
n where n is the number of

6116
05:32:05,400 --> 05:32:09,440
Cycles number of Cycles it is a number

6117
05:32:09,440 --> 05:32:13,360
of Cycles clear number of Cycles if you

6118
05:32:13,360 --> 05:32:16,280
run 30 Cycles then that means 2 to^ 30

6119
05:32:16,280 --> 05:32:18,840
This Is How They will further amplify in

6120
05:32:18,840 --> 05:32:22,040
this way they will amplify done clear

6121
05:32:22,040 --> 05:32:25,600
now here what we use is a append off

6122
05:32:25,600 --> 05:32:29,040
tube so we have a append off tube like

6123
05:32:29,040 --> 05:32:31,160
this

6124
05:32:31,160 --> 05:32:35,040
append off tube right in this endof tube

6125
05:32:35,040 --> 05:32:38,200
we add some

6126
05:32:38,240 --> 05:32:42,638
substances we add the

6127
05:32:42,638 --> 05:32:45,718
ntps we add these are the required

6128
05:32:45,718 --> 05:32:47,878
substances we add

6129
05:32:47,878 --> 05:32:53,080
dntp we will add the gene of

6130
05:32:53,958 --> 05:32:57,360
interest interest which we want to

6131
05:32:57,360 --> 05:33:02,040
amplify right we will add mg2+

6132
05:33:02,040 --> 05:33:05,798
ion we will add tar

6133
05:33:05,798 --> 05:33:09,360
polymerase given in your

6134
05:33:09,840 --> 05:33:12,718
ncrt T polymerase is that polymer

6135
05:33:12,718 --> 05:33:15,000
polymerase enzymes they are used for the

6136
05:33:15,000 --> 05:33:18,400
making the copy of a DNA clear so this T

6137
05:33:18,400 --> 05:33:21,320
polymerase is the one which is isolated

6138
05:33:21,320 --> 05:33:24,480
from thermos

6139
05:33:26,160 --> 05:33:28,958
aquaticus thermas

6140
05:33:28,958 --> 05:33:31,600
aquaticus

6141
05:33:31,600 --> 05:33:34,958
isolated from thermos

6142
05:33:34,958 --> 05:33:40,958
aquaticus which is found in Spring hot

6143
05:33:42,920 --> 05:33:48,240
spring found in Hot

6144
05:33:49,798 --> 05:33:52,160
Springs right because they are found in

6145
05:33:52,160 --> 05:33:54,000
hot spring and if you increase a

6146
05:33:54,000 --> 05:33:56,120
temperature also of this machine nothing

6147
05:33:56,120 --> 05:33:57,680
will happen to this polymerase so they

6148
05:33:57,680 --> 05:34:00,480
are thero stable what they are is they

6149
05:34:00,480 --> 05:34:03,360
are thero stable T polymerase added

6150
05:34:03,360 --> 05:34:07,920
clear dntps we have also added okay

6151
05:34:07,920 --> 05:34:10,360
clear everyone we will add

6152
05:34:10,360 --> 05:34:14,680
oligonucleotide primers also some common

6153
05:34:14,680 --> 05:34:17,320
oligo

6154
05:34:17,320 --> 05:34:20,320
nucleotide

6155
05:34:21,558 --> 05:34:23,920
primers these are the materials you have

6156
05:34:23,920 --> 05:34:25,958
to collect before starting the machine

6157
05:34:25,958 --> 05:34:29,000
of a polymerase Chain Reaction now let's

6158
05:34:29,000 --> 05:34:31,878
talk about the

6159
05:34:32,760 --> 05:34:35,760
steps

6160
05:34:36,080 --> 05:34:40,520
steps of

6161
05:34:42,440 --> 05:34:45,638
PCR there are three steps in which your

6162
05:34:45,638 --> 05:34:51,400
PCR machine works so first step is the

6163
05:34:56,280 --> 05:34:59,320
denaturation in the denaturation step

6164
05:34:59,320 --> 05:35:02,718
temperature increases

6165
05:35:03,200 --> 05:35:09,200
to 95 around 95° C so it is like you

6166
05:35:09,200 --> 05:35:10,798
have the end off you have added

6167
05:35:10,798 --> 05:35:12,718
everything now you will place that in

6168
05:35:12,718 --> 05:35:16,000
the PCR machine so in the first step it

6169
05:35:16,000 --> 05:35:18,520
will increase the temperature that is a

6170
05:35:18,520 --> 05:35:20,040
denaturation

6171
05:35:20,040 --> 05:35:25,080
clear yes Arya clear Arya Mishra yes yes

6172
05:35:25,080 --> 05:35:28,000
yes yes great great great okay we will

6173
05:35:28,000 --> 05:35:30,718
increase the temperature to 92 2 to 95°

6174
05:35:30,718 --> 05:35:33,280
C it depends ver be it depends on the CG

6175
05:35:33,280 --> 05:35:35,878
content right how many C and G are there

6176
05:35:35,878 --> 05:35:37,558
so it depend on

6177
05:35:37,558 --> 05:35:41,840
that now this is a DNA

6178
05:35:42,080 --> 05:35:44,320
strand which are having which are

6179
05:35:44,320 --> 05:35:46,920
hydrogen bonded to each other five Prime

6180
05:35:46,920 --> 05:35:48,120
to three

6181
05:35:48,120 --> 05:35:51,360
Prime 3 Prime to five

6182
05:35:51,360 --> 05:35:53,840
Prime right as you will increase the

6183
05:35:53,840 --> 05:35:55,958
temperature now what will happen there

6184
05:35:55,958 --> 05:35:58,400
will be

6185
05:35:58,680 --> 05:36:00,400
separation

6186
05:36:00,400 --> 05:36:03,040
the

6187
05:36:03,040 --> 05:36:04,760
types

6188
05:36:04,760 --> 05:36:08,680
here this is five Prime this is 3 Prime

6189
05:36:08,680 --> 05:36:12,878
five Prime 3 Prime they are separated

6190
05:36:12,878 --> 05:36:17,240
separated no love at all temperature is

6191
05:36:17,240 --> 05:36:20,160
increased step number two if you'll say

6192
05:36:20,160 --> 05:36:22,718
m it is 92° cus written you can use the

6193
05:36:22,718 --> 05:36:25,080
word 92 also it depends actually I'm

6194
05:36:25,080 --> 05:36:26,600
telling you for the CG

6195
05:36:26,600 --> 05:36:31,680
content yeah second one

6196
05:36:33,680 --> 05:36:36,080
analing second step is

6197
05:36:36,080 --> 05:36:39,120
analing now what is this unhealing

6198
05:36:39,120 --> 05:36:42,040
unhealing means to

6199
05:36:42,040 --> 05:36:45,280
stick unhealing means to stick now what

6200
05:36:45,280 --> 05:36:50,480
will happen here these are the two

6201
05:36:50,558 --> 05:36:55,040
strands right five Prime to 3 Prime

6202
05:36:55,040 --> 05:37:01,600
right three prime to five Prime right

6203
05:37:07,360 --> 05:37:10,320
now what will happen olon nucleotide

6204
05:37:10,320 --> 05:37:11,760
primer they will come and they will

6205
05:37:11,760 --> 05:37:13,400
attach over

6206
05:37:13,400 --> 05:37:16,558
here 5 Prime 3

6207
05:37:16,558 --> 05:37:18,320
Prime they will come and they will

6208
05:37:18,320 --> 05:37:20,400
attach over here analing of

6209
05:37:20,400 --> 05:37:23,080
oligonucletide

6210
05:37:23,080 --> 05:37:26,400
primer small nucleotide primer five

6211
05:37:26,400 --> 05:37:28,840
Prime to 3 Prime they will provide

6212
05:37:28,840 --> 05:37:33,040
overhanging three prime o group so

6213
05:37:33,040 --> 05:37:38,718
here temperature comes down 50 to 55°

6214
05:37:43,798 --> 05:37:47,718
C degree celsius the temperature will

6215
05:37:47,718 --> 05:37:50,680
increase clear and because of this they

6216
05:37:50,680 --> 05:37:53,160
will unal second step analing is clear

6217
05:37:53,160 --> 05:37:57,680
moving on to the third step step number

6218
05:37:57,680 --> 05:38:02,200
three step number three is

6219
05:38:02,878 --> 05:38:06,320
extension or

6220
05:38:15,680 --> 05:38:18,280
polymerization extension or

6221
05:38:18,280 --> 05:38:22,920
polymerization clear now what will

6222
05:38:23,360 --> 05:38:27,040
happen let's draw this

6223
05:38:28,520 --> 05:38:31,520
again

6224
05:38:59,840 --> 05:39:03,400
now same same I have drawn again okay

6225
05:39:03,400 --> 05:39:06,478
now what will happen buddies now the

6226
05:39:06,478 --> 05:39:08,400
polymerase which polymerase the tar

6227
05:39:08,400 --> 05:39:10,760
polymerase will come and T polymerase

6228
05:39:10,760 --> 05:39:14,080
will keep on adding the oligonucleotide

6229
05:39:14,080 --> 05:39:16,478
in this

6230
05:39:16,558 --> 05:39:21,160
direction right oligonucleotide so it is

6231
05:39:21,160 --> 05:39:25,878
like I'm writing here T

6232
05:39:26,478 --> 05:39:28,440
polymerase will

6233
05:39:28,440 --> 05:39:31,440
add

6234
05:39:33,200 --> 05:39:37,840
oligonucleotide primer sorry

6235
05:39:39,958 --> 05:39:44,080
dnps d n TPS in the presence of

6236
05:39:44,080 --> 05:39:47,040
magnesium ion that's it and here the

6237
05:39:47,040 --> 05:39:49,478
temperature is what here the temperature

6238
05:39:49,478 --> 05:39:51,798
is

6239
05:39:51,798 --> 05:39:55,080
almost here the temperature is almost

6240
05:39:55,080 --> 05:39:57,638
what around

6241
05:39:57,638 --> 05:40:00,040
72° C

6242
05:40:00,040 --> 05:40:01,600
now the temperature will increase so in

6243
05:40:01,600 --> 05:40:04,160
one cycle what we will get is complete

6244
05:40:04,160 --> 05:40:08,000
synthesis see it will be now completely

6245
05:40:08,000 --> 05:40:10,400
synthesized completely synthesized isn't

6246
05:40:10,400 --> 05:40:12,040
it done done done done completely

6247
05:40:12,040 --> 05:40:15,080
synthesized now one strand is converted

6248
05:40:15,080 --> 05:40:19,120
into two strand one cycle one multip by

6249
05:40:19,120 --> 05:40:20,760
two we'll get

6250
05:40:20,760 --> 05:40:23,958
twos is this point clear to everyone so

6251
05:40:23,958 --> 05:40:26,240
this is a

6252
05:40:26,240 --> 05:40:28,878
PCR moving on to the next is insertion

6253
05:40:28,878 --> 05:40:31,440
of DN D into the host cell there are

6254
05:40:31,440 --> 05:40:34,680
various Ways by which we can insert the

6255
05:40:34,680 --> 05:40:37,638
DNA into the host cell let's talk about

6256
05:40:37,638 --> 05:40:42,440
it okay insertion of DNA into the host

6257
05:40:56,840 --> 05:41:01,240
cell into

6258
05:41:01,478 --> 05:41:03,680
host

6259
05:41:03,680 --> 05:41:07,798
cell insertion of the DNA into the host

6260
05:41:07,798 --> 05:41:10,120
cell how can we insert the DNA into the

6261
05:41:10,120 --> 05:41:13,440
host cell let's have a look DNA can be

6262
05:41:13,440 --> 05:41:17,600
inserted into the host cell by different

6263
05:41:17,600 --> 05:41:20,520
ways one of the treatment is calcium

6264
05:41:20,520 --> 05:41:22,200
chloride guys have you heard of it come

6265
05:41:22,200 --> 05:41:24,558
on tell me have you heard of it the

6266
05:41:24,558 --> 05:41:27,440
calcium carbonate treatment the um

6267
05:41:27,440 --> 05:41:30,558
electric treatment which we use do you

6268
05:41:30,558 --> 05:41:33,798
are are you guys aware of

6269
05:41:34,760 --> 05:41:38,200
it come on come on come on then I'll

6270
05:41:38,200 --> 05:41:40,558
explain

6271
05:41:43,120 --> 05:41:45,638
you so I'll write

6272
05:41:45,638 --> 05:41:48,638
down

6273
05:41:50,760 --> 05:41:52,400
calcium

6274
05:41:52,400 --> 05:41:56,520
CA CO3

6275
05:41:58,160 --> 05:41:59,920
treatment

6276
05:41:59,920 --> 05:42:02,958
right now what we do is we treat the

6277
05:42:02,958 --> 05:42:06,080
cell right we take the

6278
05:42:06,080 --> 05:42:11,000
cell plus foreign DNA which we have to

6279
05:42:11,000 --> 05:42:12,798
insert

6280
05:42:12,798 --> 05:42:16,718
right both of them right both of them

6281
05:42:16,718 --> 05:42:20,320
and we will add calcium

6282
05:42:20,320 --> 05:42:22,680
chloride and because of the calcium

6283
05:42:22,680 --> 05:42:24,878
chloride because once we add the calcium

6284
05:42:24,878 --> 05:42:29,200
chloride calcium chloride increases the

6285
05:42:29,200 --> 05:42:31,958
absorption

6286
05:42:36,120 --> 05:42:41,200
of DNA by host

6287
05:42:41,558 --> 05:42:45,440
cell host cell see actually uh DNA

6288
05:42:45,440 --> 05:42:49,600
cannot go directly because DNA is what

6289
05:42:49,600 --> 05:42:52,000
you know lipid DNA is

6290
05:42:52,000 --> 05:42:55,400
hydrophilic we all know right this DNA

6291
05:42:55,400 --> 05:43:01,080
is what DNA is hydrophilic

6292
05:43:02,958 --> 05:43:05,240
and if I talk about the

6293
05:43:05,240 --> 05:43:08,040
membrane cell

6294
05:43:08,040 --> 05:43:11,680
membrane cell membrane is

6295
05:43:11,680 --> 05:43:14,440
hydrophobic so they cannot you know then

6296
05:43:14,440 --> 05:43:16,958
they cannot fall in love with each other

6297
05:43:16,958 --> 05:43:18,958
so how can we make them fall in love

6298
05:43:18,958 --> 05:43:21,160
with each other first add calcium

6299
05:43:21,160 --> 05:43:23,280
carbonate let's talk about the step

6300
05:43:23,280 --> 05:43:26,160
number two or the second second method

6301
05:43:26,160 --> 05:43:27,840
that is a heat shock this is the most

6302
05:43:27,840 --> 05:43:29,920
torturous method I feel

6303
05:43:29,920 --> 05:43:32,638
heat

6304
05:43:34,120 --> 05:43:38,478
shock method so in a heat shock method

6305
05:43:38,478 --> 05:43:41,440
what we do is we first of all heat the

6306
05:43:41,440 --> 05:43:44,200
mixture we

6307
05:43:44,200 --> 05:43:49,000
heat we then place it

6308
05:43:49,000 --> 05:43:51,000
on

6309
05:43:51,000 --> 05:43:54,680
ice then again we

6310
05:43:55,160 --> 05:43:59,400
Heat this is the one which we do heat

6311
05:43:59,400 --> 05:44:02,240
shock isn't it torturous just imagine

6312
05:44:02,240 --> 05:44:04,280
you facing this

6313
05:44:04,280 --> 05:44:08,920
situation so here what we do

6314
05:44:09,600 --> 05:44:14,000
is okay so here buddies what we do is

6315
05:44:14,000 --> 05:44:19,718
because of this this create transient

6316
05:44:21,160 --> 05:44:22,958
Poe

6317
05:44:22,958 --> 05:44:25,798
transient

6318
05:44:25,798 --> 05:44:29,600
force on cell and when they create

6319
05:44:29,600 --> 05:44:31,958
transient Poe on Cell easy absorption

6320
05:44:31,958 --> 05:44:32,760
can

6321
05:44:32,760 --> 05:44:36,320
occur is this point clear to all of

6322
05:44:36,320 --> 05:44:38,600
you so heat doesn't mean that we are

6323
05:44:38,600 --> 05:44:41,798
giving 800° cus it is very normal means

6324
05:44:41,798 --> 05:44:45,958
42° C then ice and again 42°

6325
05:44:45,958 --> 05:44:49,878
C clear now there are other ways Also

6326
05:44:49,878 --> 05:44:52,360
let's talk about

6327
05:44:52,360 --> 05:44:54,760
them other

6328
05:44:54,760 --> 05:44:57,760
ways

6329
05:44:57,878 --> 05:45:00,878
biolistic

6330
05:45:02,878 --> 05:45:06,000
biolistic biolistic is also termed as

6331
05:45:06,000 --> 05:45:08,360
Gene

6332
05:45:08,360 --> 05:45:09,958
gun

6333
05:45:09,958 --> 05:45:13,478
so here this is used in the case of

6334
05:45:13,478 --> 05:45:15,360
plants suppose we have to do

6335
05:45:15,360 --> 05:45:18,200
transformation in Plants this is for

6336
05:45:18,200 --> 05:45:21,400
transformation in

6337
05:45:24,120 --> 05:45:28,160
Plants transformation in Plants right in

6338
05:45:28,160 --> 05:45:30,520
this case what we will use is we will

6339
05:45:30,520 --> 05:45:34,080
use gold or

6340
05:45:36,280 --> 05:45:37,878
tungsten

6341
05:45:37,878 --> 05:45:40,878
tungsten

6342
05:45:40,958 --> 05:45:43,840
qued

6343
05:45:43,840 --> 05:45:48,400
bullets right and on that we add DNA

6344
05:45:48,400 --> 05:45:51,320
also they have DNA

6345
05:45:51,320 --> 05:45:54,798
also and then we bombard it on the plant

6346
05:45:54,798 --> 05:45:56,798
cell it is possible to do this on the

6347
05:45:56,798 --> 05:45:59,440
plant cell right plant cell

6348
05:45:59,440 --> 05:46:03,040
yes this is bombarded now on the next

6349
05:46:03,040 --> 05:46:05,120
method micro

6350
05:46:05,120 --> 05:46:08,200
injection small injection let's take a

6351
05:46:08,200 --> 05:46:12,040
DNA micro

6352
05:46:12,200 --> 05:46:14,478
injection let's insert the DNA with the

6353
05:46:14,478 --> 05:46:16,160
help of a injection this I'm not

6354
05:46:16,160 --> 05:46:18,638
explaining in detail now the last one is

6355
05:46:18,638 --> 05:46:21,638
the disarmed

6356
05:46:22,120 --> 05:46:24,718
pathogen is hared

6357
05:46:24,718 --> 05:46:29,400
Vector or pathogen for example

6358
05:46:29,400 --> 05:46:32,160
when we have to we can use retrovirus

6359
05:46:32,160 --> 05:46:34,840
disarmed again I'm saying

6360
05:46:34,840 --> 05:46:37,120
retrovirus when we have to use this in

6361
05:46:37,120 --> 05:46:39,520
case of plants oh

6362
05:46:39,520 --> 05:46:42,520
sorry

6363
05:46:45,558 --> 05:46:49,080
animals TI plasmid you know TI plasmid

6364
05:46:49,080 --> 05:46:51,320
cause Crown Gall disease in plant but

6365
05:46:51,320 --> 05:46:53,920
disarmed one when we use we can do the

6366
05:46:53,920 --> 05:46:57,000
transformation in case of plants right

6367
05:46:57,000 --> 05:47:00,120
but make sure it should be dis

6368
05:47:00,120 --> 05:47:03,520
harmed yes clear to all my

6369
05:47:03,520 --> 05:47:07,958
buddies okay so let's move

6370
05:47:08,000 --> 05:47:10,718
further now next next let's look at the

6371
05:47:10,718 --> 05:47:13,718
next Point insertion is done obtaining

6372
05:47:13,718 --> 05:47:16,478
the foreign Gene product obtaining the

6373
05:47:16,478 --> 05:47:20,760
foreign Gene product good aush CH now

6374
05:47:20,760 --> 05:47:24,280
let's have a look for obtaining a gene

6375
05:47:24,280 --> 05:47:26,718
product what we use we use these

6376
05:47:26,718 --> 05:47:28,878
bioreactors there are two type of bi bio

6377
05:47:28,878 --> 05:47:30,798
reactor this is a simple stirred tank

6378
05:47:30,798 --> 05:47:32,878
bioreactor and the second is a spared

6379
05:47:32,878 --> 05:47:36,440
tank bioreactor SED tank bioreactor is

6380
05:47:36,440 --> 05:47:38,360
like there will be a stirer there will

6381
05:47:38,360 --> 05:47:41,160
be a foam breaker there will be imperor

6382
05:47:41,160 --> 05:47:43,840
who keeps on impelling we add culture

6383
05:47:43,840 --> 05:47:46,680
brow we add our cell we have to culture

6384
05:47:46,680 --> 05:47:49,520
we maintain the temperature also Steam

6385
05:47:49,520 --> 05:47:52,000
for sterilization we maintain the pH

6386
05:47:52,000 --> 05:47:55,840
also everything we maintain and at

6387
05:47:55,840 --> 05:47:58,320
Thousand level capacity we can easily

6388
05:47:58,320 --> 05:48:00,280
culture

6389
05:48:00,280 --> 05:48:02,400
on the another hand we have the sped

6390
05:48:02,400 --> 05:48:04,798
tank bio reactors also both have a same

6391
05:48:04,798 --> 05:48:07,040
function but they are of different types

6392
05:48:07,040 --> 05:48:09,798
clear there are two type of culture

6393
05:48:09,798 --> 05:48:12,000
system

6394
05:48:12,000 --> 05:48:14,478
culture can be done in two different

6395
05:48:14,478 --> 05:48:17,718
ways one is a continuous

6396
05:48:17,718 --> 05:48:20,440
culture continuous culture and second is

6397
05:48:20,440 --> 05:48:23,440
a discontinuous

6398
05:48:24,638 --> 05:48:28,280
culture in the continuous one continuous

6399
05:48:28,280 --> 05:48:32,520
one what we do is continuous see there

6400
05:48:32,520 --> 05:48:35,478
are two different ways

6401
05:48:35,478 --> 05:48:39,400
uh we will add some

6402
05:48:39,400 --> 05:48:42,320
yes so what we will do is it's like we

6403
05:48:42,320 --> 05:48:45,040
will add something right we will CL it's

6404
05:48:45,040 --> 05:48:47,200
just like a cooker right it's just like

6405
05:48:47,200 --> 05:48:49,320
a discontinuous we have a cooker we've

6406
05:48:49,320 --> 05:48:51,360
added all the vegetables now we will

6407
05:48:51,360 --> 05:48:53,280
close the cooker we will open only

6408
05:48:53,280 --> 05:48:55,680
cooker once when our food is

6409
05:48:55,680 --> 05:48:57,760
prepared now another one in the

6410
05:48:57,760 --> 05:49:01,000
discontinuous one one what we do uh in

6411
05:49:01,000 --> 05:49:03,440
the another one sorry what we use is we

6412
05:49:03,440 --> 05:49:04,958
keep on adding the vegetables from

6413
05:49:04,958 --> 05:49:07,200
outside we keep on adding the you know

6414
05:49:07,200 --> 05:49:09,040
the culture medium from outside and we

6415
05:49:09,040 --> 05:49:11,080
will keep on obtaining the product from

6416
05:49:11,080 --> 05:49:12,558
Lower

6417
05:49:12,558 --> 05:49:17,558
Side done clear okay so these are the

6418
05:49:17,558 --> 05:49:20,320
two ways okay guys is this clear maximum

6419
05:49:20,320 --> 05:49:23,600
level and then once we will get the cell

6420
05:49:23,600 --> 05:49:26,160
lots of cells we can easily isolate them

6421
05:49:26,160 --> 05:49:27,760
with the help of a process which is

6422
05:49:27,760 --> 05:49:29,320
Downstream

6423
05:49:29,320 --> 05:49:33,878
processing so Downstream

6424
05:49:40,200 --> 05:49:42,240
processing so continuous means

6425
05:49:42,240 --> 05:49:43,760
continuously we are adding substances

6426
05:49:43,760 --> 05:49:45,360
from outside and From Below we are

6427
05:49:45,360 --> 05:49:47,200
extracting the product so there are

6428
05:49:47,200 --> 05:49:49,718
chances of contamination at that time

6429
05:49:49,718 --> 05:49:51,478
discontinuous means once we have closed

6430
05:49:51,478 --> 05:49:53,120
the cooker once we have closed this

6431
05:49:53,120 --> 05:49:55,400
thing now we cannot add anything from

6432
05:49:55,400 --> 05:49:59,160
outside yes great so next isolation of

6433
05:49:59,160 --> 05:50:00,600
product can be done by Downstream

6434
05:50:00,600 --> 05:50:02,200
processing so Downstream processing may

6435
05:50:02,200 --> 05:50:04,718
involve the ultra centrifugation uh

6436
05:50:04,718 --> 05:50:06,878
various ways

6437
05:50:06,878 --> 05:50:09,840
of in fact chromatography is also one of

6438
05:50:09,840 --> 05:50:11,840
the ways by which we can isolate the

6439
05:50:11,840 --> 05:50:13,000
desired

6440
05:50:13,000 --> 05:50:16,958
product okay buddies so so so so with

6441
05:50:16,958 --> 05:50:19,120
this we have completed your this chapter

6442
05:50:19,120 --> 05:50:20,760
also what is this that is a

6443
05:50:20,760 --> 05:50:23,718
biotechnology principle and

6444
05:50:23,718 --> 05:50:26,280
processes

6445
05:50:26,280 --> 05:50:31,080
right six hours okay four chapters down

6446
05:50:31,080 --> 05:50:34,240
good good good now we have to move on to

6447
05:50:34,240 --> 05:50:36,280
the next chapter that is a biot

6448
05:50:36,280 --> 05:50:38,120
technology and its

6449
05:50:38,120 --> 05:50:40,760
application right can we start this

6450
05:50:40,760 --> 05:50:42,440
chapter bi technology and its

6451
05:50:42,440 --> 05:50:45,878
applications come on tell

6452
05:50:52,840 --> 05:50:54,920
me

6453
05:50:54,920 --> 05:50:57,878
yes biotechnology application is

6454
05:50:57,878 --> 05:51:01,600
comparative ly uh you can say a smaller

6455
05:51:01,600 --> 05:51:04,440
chapter it's not that big one it's a

6456
05:51:04,440 --> 05:51:07,558
small as compared to the uh you know the

6457
05:51:07,558 --> 05:51:08,440
other

6458
05:51:08,440 --> 05:51:10,718
chapters so let's do this biot

6459
05:51:10,718 --> 05:51:13,280
technology

6460
05:51:13,280 --> 05:51:14,920
application so you know the

6461
05:51:14,920 --> 05:51:17,080
biotechnology biotechnology is we are

6462
05:51:17,080 --> 05:51:18,878
modifying it we are using genetic

6463
05:51:18,878 --> 05:51:20,558
engineering and we are using

6464
05:51:20,558 --> 05:51:23,080
bioprocesses yes then previously other

6465
05:51:23,080 --> 05:51:25,000
chapters whatever is there now

6466
05:51:25,000 --> 05:51:27,360
application of biotechnology there are

6467
05:51:27,360 --> 05:51:29,718
various applications of biotechnology

6468
05:51:29,718 --> 05:51:32,240
one is Therapeutics diagnostic

6469
05:51:32,240 --> 05:51:33,920
genetically modified crop for

6470
05:51:33,920 --> 05:51:35,718
agriculture processed food bior

6471
05:51:35,718 --> 05:51:38,120
remediation waste material removal and

6472
05:51:38,120 --> 05:51:39,240
the energy

6473
05:51:39,240 --> 05:51:42,040
production these are the different

6474
05:51:42,040 --> 05:51:46,160
ways right

6475
05:51:46,400 --> 05:51:49,958
okay three critical areas of the

6476
05:51:49,958 --> 05:51:53,558
research in biotechnology are see

6477
05:51:53,558 --> 05:51:55,160
biotechnology what we are doing is we

6478
05:51:55,160 --> 05:51:57,760
are modifying something right we are

6479
05:51:57,760 --> 05:52:01,080
modifying something here it provide the

6480
05:52:01,080 --> 05:52:03,000
best Catalyst in the form of improved

6481
05:52:03,000 --> 05:52:07,440
organism usually a microbes or the pure

6482
05:52:07,440 --> 05:52:10,558
enzyme what see biotechnology may we are

6483
05:52:10,558 --> 05:52:12,878
modifying any organism so what we need

6484
05:52:12,878 --> 05:52:15,718
is that organism providing the best

6485
05:52:15,718 --> 05:52:18,638
catalyst is that thing on which we can

6486
05:52:18,638 --> 05:52:21,920
work in the form of improved organism

6487
05:52:21,920 --> 05:52:25,160
that improved organism usually a microb

6488
05:52:25,160 --> 05:52:28,280
or a pure enzyme that thing is required

6489
05:52:28,280 --> 05:52:30,240
creating a optimal condition through

6490
05:52:30,240 --> 05:52:32,680
engineering for a catalyst to act

6491
05:52:32,680 --> 05:52:34,840
creating particular environmental

6492
05:52:34,840 --> 05:52:36,360
condition that comes under the

6493
05:52:36,360 --> 05:52:37,798
bioprocessing if you remember the

6494
05:52:37,798 --> 05:52:40,840
previous chapter Downstream processing

6495
05:52:40,840 --> 05:52:43,360
technology to purify the protein or

6496
05:52:43,360 --> 05:52:45,478
organic compound the first thing is we

6497
05:52:45,478 --> 05:52:48,040
will modify something or whatever is

6498
05:52:48,040 --> 05:52:49,840
there whatever is already available we

6499
05:52:49,840 --> 05:52:52,680
will use them then we will culture it as

6500
05:52:52,680 --> 05:52:55,040
given in the second Point third thing is

6501
05:52:55,040 --> 05:52:56,798
Downstream processing means we will

6502
05:52:56,798 --> 05:53:00,040
isolate the product

6503
05:53:00,040 --> 05:53:01,558
whatever organic compounds are there we

6504
05:53:01,558 --> 05:53:05,280
will isolate them now biotechnology

6505
05:53:05,280 --> 05:53:07,718
application in agriculture there are

6506
05:53:07,718 --> 05:53:09,718
various uh you know applications are

6507
05:53:09,718 --> 05:53:12,240
there

6508
05:53:12,240 --> 05:53:14,760
see with increasing population like we

6509
05:53:14,760 --> 05:53:16,958
have read in the chapter number two of

6510
05:53:16,958 --> 05:53:18,638
zoology which is reproductive Health

6511
05:53:18,638 --> 05:53:20,878
there was a major issue and that major

6512
05:53:20,878 --> 05:53:22,958
issue was related to the

6513
05:53:22,958 --> 05:53:25,798
population increasing you know

6514
05:53:25,798 --> 05:53:28,520
population in millions it was difficult

6515
05:53:28,520 --> 05:53:31,440
to feed those number of individuals so

6516
05:53:31,440 --> 05:53:34,400
what we did we tried to increase the

6517
05:53:34,400 --> 05:53:36,798
agriculture right by that only we can

6518
05:53:36,798 --> 05:53:39,878
provide them food so we started using

6519
05:53:39,878 --> 05:53:42,840
some chemicals we started using some

6520
05:53:42,840 --> 05:53:44,520
chemicals like insecticide and

6521
05:53:44,520 --> 05:53:47,040
pesticides and we when we started using

6522
05:53:47,040 --> 05:53:49,160
those insecticide and pesticide what

6523
05:53:49,160 --> 05:53:51,840
happened production increased and

6524
05:53:51,840 --> 05:53:53,798
because of that insecticide and

6525
05:53:53,798 --> 05:53:55,718
pesticide they had some residual effects

6526
05:53:55,718 --> 05:53:58,478
also though this lead to the Green

6527
05:53:58,478 --> 05:54:00,638
Revolution also which later we realized

6528
05:54:00,638 --> 05:54:02,280
that these pesticides are not good for

6529
05:54:02,280 --> 05:54:05,120
our body second we moved on to the

6530
05:54:05,120 --> 05:54:08,120
organic agriculture organic agriculture

6531
05:54:08,120 --> 05:54:10,160
organic agriculture now aays we are

6532
05:54:10,160 --> 05:54:11,958
moving towards organic foods organic

6533
05:54:11,958 --> 05:54:14,760
pses organic vegetables where the no

6534
05:54:14,760 --> 05:54:16,958
where zero pesticides zero insecticides

6535
05:54:16,958 --> 05:54:17,718
are

6536
05:54:17,718 --> 05:54:20,520
used we moving but overall production is

6537
05:54:20,520 --> 05:54:22,440
less in this case now next is

6538
05:54:22,440 --> 05:54:24,798
genetically engineered cobbed based

6539
05:54:24,798 --> 05:54:27,400
agriculture now this is the one which we

6540
05:54:27,400 --> 05:54:29,840
are targeting today that is the

6541
05:54:29,840 --> 05:54:32,320
genetically engineered cred based

6542
05:54:32,320 --> 05:54:34,200
agriculture now what this genetically

6543
05:54:34,200 --> 05:54:36,240
engineered crop-based agriculture is

6544
05:54:36,240 --> 05:54:40,360
let's have a look we have made the crops

6545
05:54:40,360 --> 05:54:43,240
more tolerant to abiotic stress now

6546
05:54:43,240 --> 05:54:46,160
let's have a look either it is a drought

6547
05:54:46,160 --> 05:54:49,080
or it is a cold it is a salt or a heat

6548
05:54:49,080 --> 05:54:50,878
nothing can happen to our plant because

6549
05:54:50,878 --> 05:54:52,360
our plant are

6550
05:54:52,360 --> 05:54:56,478
resistant next reduced reli Reliance on

6551
05:54:56,478 --> 05:54:58,840
the chemical pesticide

6552
05:54:58,840 --> 05:55:00,878
we don't want pesticides who wants

6553
05:55:00,878 --> 05:55:03,760
pesticide we don't want pesticides help

6554
05:55:03,760 --> 05:55:06,478
to reduce post Harvest loss when we are

6555
05:55:06,478 --> 05:55:09,000
storing those food in bulk nothing can

6556
05:55:09,000 --> 05:55:12,680
happen to them next increased efficiency

6557
05:55:12,680 --> 05:55:15,600
of mineral usage by plants more and more

6558
05:55:15,600 --> 05:55:17,638
plants are extracting nutrients from the

6559
05:55:17,638 --> 05:55:21,160
soil even when they are at dwarf prod

6560
05:55:21,160 --> 05:55:22,878
you know when when they are small and

6561
05:55:22,878 --> 05:55:25,000
high they're producing fruit how it is

6562
05:55:25,000 --> 05:55:27,000
possible bi technology

6563
05:55:27,000 --> 05:55:29,080
only

6564
05:55:29,080 --> 05:55:31,760
enhanced nutritional value for example

6565
05:55:31,760 --> 05:55:33,400
today we have produced golden rice

6566
05:55:33,400 --> 05:55:35,120
golden rice means doesn't means it is

6567
05:55:35,120 --> 05:55:37,040
golden it's made up of gold it doesn't

6568
05:55:37,040 --> 05:55:39,400
mean that golden rice means it is yellow

6569
05:55:39,400 --> 05:55:42,400
color rice which is rich in vitamin A

6570
05:55:42,400 --> 05:55:44,600
okay so with the help of all these

6571
05:55:44,600 --> 05:55:47,638
things today all biotechnology we have

6572
05:55:47,638 --> 05:55:50,520
made these things possible so everybody

6573
05:55:50,520 --> 05:55:53,040
my cbsc aspirant keep these points in

6574
05:55:53,040 --> 05:55:54,520
your

6575
05:55:54,520 --> 05:55:56,920
mind okay

6576
05:55:56,920 --> 05:55:59,000
now

6577
05:55:59,000 --> 05:56:01,200
what we have prepared so far let's talk

6578
05:56:01,200 --> 05:56:03,280
about it have you how many of you have

6579
05:56:03,280 --> 05:56:06,400
heard of B

6580
05:56:07,000 --> 05:56:09,520
cotton come

6581
05:56:09,520 --> 05:56:13,200
on how many of you heard of BT

6582
05:56:13,200 --> 05:56:16,320
cotton today we have prepared a cotton

6583
05:56:16,320 --> 05:56:19,840
plant whose name is BT cotton we have

6584
05:56:19,840 --> 05:56:22,080
modified it we have modified a cotton

6585
05:56:22,080 --> 05:56:23,638
how we have modified a cotton let's have

6586
05:56:23,638 --> 05:56:26,878
a look there's a

6587
05:56:26,878 --> 05:56:28,920
bacteria

6588
05:56:28,920 --> 05:56:33,440
whose name was bassilus

6589
05:56:34,040 --> 05:56:38,320
tranis bassilus

6590
05:56:40,000 --> 05:56:42,440
tranis

6591
05:56:42,440 --> 05:56:45,440
ganis basil tranis what's the name

6592
05:56:45,440 --> 05:56:46,798
bassilus

6593
05:56:46,798 --> 05:56:50,718
tranis bassilus Tanis produce a protein

6594
05:56:50,718 --> 05:56:54,280
what do they do is they produce

6595
05:56:55,878 --> 05:56:58,958
protein and the name of that protein is

6596
05:56:58,958 --> 05:57:01,160
cry

6597
05:57:01,160 --> 05:57:05,878
protein name of that protein is cry

6598
05:57:07,120 --> 05:57:09,558
protein name of that protein is cry

6599
05:57:09,558 --> 05:57:12,160
protein right they produce

6600
05:57:12,160 --> 05:57:14,798
it because

6601
05:57:14,798 --> 05:57:17,400
because they are having a gene which is

6602
05:57:17,400 --> 05:57:19,478
a cry

6603
05:57:19,478 --> 05:57:22,400
gene they have a gene whose name is cry

6604
05:57:22,400 --> 05:57:25,400
cry not that Rona cry this is name is

6605
05:57:25,400 --> 05:57:27,680
cry only so they produce a protein which

6606
05:57:27,680 --> 05:57:30,920
is is a cry protein and whenever insect

6607
05:57:30,920 --> 05:57:33,478
feed on

6608
05:57:33,718 --> 05:57:36,718
it

6609
05:57:36,878 --> 05:57:38,718
insect

6610
05:57:38,718 --> 05:57:41,120
feed on

6611
05:57:41,120 --> 05:57:46,920
it they die that means not bacteria the

6612
05:57:46,920 --> 05:57:49,280
insect

6613
05:57:49,280 --> 05:57:55,638
die why because it cause perforation in

6614
05:57:56,120 --> 05:58:01,160
gut it cause perforation in

6615
05:58:01,160 --> 05:58:05,478
gut right same problem was there in the

6616
05:58:05,478 --> 05:58:09,680
cotton cotton infestation cotton people

6617
05:58:09,680 --> 05:58:12,440
the uh you know Farmers they were facing

6618
05:58:12,440 --> 05:58:15,478
some problem in Cotton they say either

6619
05:58:15,478 --> 05:58:17,840
it is

6620
05:58:20,400 --> 05:58:25,000
lepidopteran or it is colop

6621
05:58:26,718 --> 05:58:29,080
Terin

6622
05:58:29,080 --> 05:58:32,000
or it is

6623
05:58:33,200 --> 05:58:36,680
dip we are tired of all

6624
05:58:36,680 --> 05:58:39,718
three they cause huge

6625
05:58:39,718 --> 05:58:42,958
infestation yes they cause huge

6626
05:58:42,958 --> 05:58:45,440
infestation leibo Teran comes your

6627
05:58:45,440 --> 05:58:48,558
butterfly Ms Etc in the colop Teran we

6628
05:58:48,558 --> 05:58:50,878
have is a beetle in the dipin we have is

6629
05:58:50,878 --> 05:58:52,478
a flies and

6630
05:58:52,478 --> 05:58:54,520
mosquitoes

6631
05:58:54,520 --> 05:58:56,240
okay

6632
05:58:56,240 --> 05:58:59,200
lepidopteran call of Teran and

6633
05:58:59,200 --> 05:59:01,360
dptr clear

6634
05:59:01,360 --> 05:59:04,320
cotton now scientist thought let's take

6635
05:59:04,320 --> 05:59:07,040
a use of this bassilus through gianis

6636
05:59:07,040 --> 05:59:09,160
then what scientist did scientist

6637
05:59:09,160 --> 05:59:12,000
isolated

6638
05:59:12,000 --> 05:59:14,040
Crye

6639
05:59:14,040 --> 05:59:19,080
Cene and they inserted into the

6640
05:59:19,760 --> 05:59:22,798
cotton right Ken into the cotton now the

6641
05:59:22,798 --> 05:59:26,600
cotton cotton becomes BT

6642
05:59:26,638 --> 05:59:28,200
cotton

6643
05:59:28,200 --> 05:59:32,120
it becomes py cotton now lepido Teran if

6644
05:59:32,120 --> 05:59:33,958
you'll come we will kill you lepido

6645
05:59:33,958 --> 05:59:36,760
Teran if cotan will come we will kill

6646
05:59:36,760 --> 05:59:40,080
you kopan if any on of uh you know if

6647
05:59:40,080 --> 05:59:44,080
dipan will come they will kill the

6648
05:59:46,360 --> 05:59:51,840
dipan so these Crye has some

6649
05:59:51,840 --> 05:59:55,040
name Cry 1

6650
05:59:55,040 --> 05:59:59,200
AC and Cry 2 2

6651
05:59:59,200 --> 06:00:02,760
AB yes these are the name of Gene when

6652
06:00:02,760 --> 06:00:05,558
the scientist they go deep into this

6653
06:00:05,558 --> 06:00:09,840
they realized Cry 1 AC and Cry 2 AB they

6654
06:00:09,840 --> 06:00:13,920
are effective against cotton

6655
06:00:14,040 --> 06:00:17,160
ball cotton

6656
06:00:17,160 --> 06:00:20,680
ballom which cause huge

6657
06:00:20,680 --> 06:00:23,878
loss which cause huge loss as far as

6658
06:00:23,878 --> 06:00:26,440
because India is one of the greater

6659
06:00:26,440 --> 06:00:29,400
greatest producer user of the cotton now

6660
06:00:29,400 --> 06:00:32,000
cry

6661
06:00:32,478 --> 06:00:34,638
1ab cry

6662
06:00:34,638 --> 06:00:37,840
1ab is used to

6663
06:00:37,840 --> 06:00:41,400
control cotton

6664
06:00:41,600 --> 06:00:45,320
budw corn borer

6665
06:00:46,600 --> 06:00:49,718
sorry quter corn

6666
06:00:49,718 --> 06:00:55,360
Boral cter corn borer cryan AC AB cotton

6667
06:00:55,360 --> 06:00:59,320
bwom cryan AB cotton corn borer so this

6668
06:00:59,320 --> 06:01:02,120
is a what B cotton today we have with us

6669
06:01:02,120 --> 06:01:04,080
not only the B cotton today we have a b

6670
06:01:04,080 --> 06:01:07,478
tomato B potato B bringel BT soy bean BT

6671
06:01:07,478 --> 06:01:10,160
chicken pea Pig pigeon pea all of them

6672
06:01:10,160 --> 06:01:14,080
today we have with us so this is the BT

6673
06:01:14,080 --> 06:01:17,080
cotton

6674
06:01:17,680 --> 06:01:22,000
now moving on to the next is neod

6675
06:01:22,000 --> 06:01:25,120
resistant tobacco plant yes guys so

6676
06:01:25,120 --> 06:01:28,080
today we have created nematode resistant

6677
06:01:28,080 --> 06:01:31,760
tobacco or plant also so there is a

6678
06:01:31,760 --> 06:01:36,920
nematode whose name is mogy in

6679
06:01:36,920 --> 06:01:39,840
cognita

6680
06:01:39,840 --> 06:01:42,840
mogy

6681
06:01:43,680 --> 06:01:47,320
incognita it is a

6682
06:01:47,320 --> 06:01:50,680
nematode it's a

6683
06:01:50,680 --> 06:01:55,000
nematode it cause huge infestation as

6684
06:01:55,000 --> 06:01:59,360
far as your tobacco is considered

6685
06:01:59,760 --> 06:02:02,600
tobacco

6686
06:02:05,680 --> 06:02:08,878
infestation right tobacco infestation so

6687
06:02:08,878 --> 06:02:10,718
scientists they were very worried are

6688
06:02:10,718 --> 06:02:12,600
how to solve this problem what to do

6689
06:02:12,600 --> 06:02:14,638
what not to do so they used one

6690
06:02:14,638 --> 06:02:17,920
technique which is RNA

6691
06:02:18,160 --> 06:02:20,718
interference

6692
06:02:20,718 --> 06:02:23,718
RNA

6693
06:02:25,280 --> 06:02:27,558
interference they use a technique which

6694
06:02:27,558 --> 06:02:30,760
is I interference RNA I that is RNA

6695
06:02:30,760 --> 06:02:34,120
interference so RNA interference is all

6696
06:02:34,120 --> 06:02:38,160
about prevention of the

6697
06:02:38,160 --> 06:02:42,040
infestation right RNA interference is a

6698
06:02:42,040 --> 06:02:44,798
Cellular

6699
06:02:44,958 --> 06:02:48,558
Defense Cellular

6700
06:02:48,558 --> 06:02:54,360
Defense in you carotic

6701
06:02:55,840 --> 06:02:58,638
organisms organ

6702
06:02:58,638 --> 06:03:02,120
isms now let's have a quick look how

6703
06:03:02,120 --> 06:03:03,400
this has been

6704
06:03:03,400 --> 06:03:07,680
done now what scientists

6705
06:03:08,440 --> 06:03:12,120
did okay they took a

6706
06:03:12,120 --> 06:03:14,600
DNA right

6707
06:03:14,600 --> 06:03:16,200
DNA

6708
06:03:16,200 --> 06:03:17,878
of

6709
06:03:17,878 --> 06:03:20,878
mogy

6710
06:03:21,440 --> 06:03:25,320
incognit and this DNA was vital this was

6711
06:03:25,320 --> 06:03:28,440
vital for them like if something will

6712
06:03:28,440 --> 06:03:30,680
happen to this Gene in their body they

6713
06:03:30,680 --> 06:03:32,600
will not be able to survive so they took

6714
06:03:32,600 --> 06:03:38,200
this they insert this into the plant

6715
06:03:38,200 --> 06:03:43,280
which plant obviously this one tobacco

6716
06:03:44,200 --> 06:03:47,520
plant tobacco

6717
06:03:47,520 --> 06:03:49,920
plant they inserted this into the

6718
06:03:49,920 --> 06:03:51,718
tobacco plant which technique did they

6719
06:03:51,718 --> 06:03:56,200
use definitely the ti

6720
06:03:56,200 --> 06:03:58,600
plasmid

6721
06:03:58,600 --> 06:04:01,718
now here they used a mechanism what they

6722
06:04:01,718 --> 06:04:05,958
did he normally if I talk about a DNA

6723
06:04:05,958 --> 06:04:09,638
only one strand replicate here both the

6724
06:04:09,638 --> 06:04:11,920
strands they replicated and they produce

6725
06:04:11,920 --> 06:04:16,160
the RNA sense Strand and anti- sense

6726
06:04:16,160 --> 06:04:19,798
strand this is the sense

6727
06:04:19,798 --> 06:04:22,558
RNA both strands they produce the

6728
06:04:22,558 --> 06:04:26,160
RNA this is the anti sense

6729
06:04:26,160 --> 06:04:29,160
RNA

6730
06:04:30,558 --> 06:04:33,360
anti sense RNA as DNA was complimentary

6731
06:04:33,360 --> 06:04:34,400
to each other so they will also be

6732
06:04:34,400 --> 06:04:36,760
complimentary to each other so what will

6733
06:04:36,760 --> 06:04:41,200
happen both will form double standard

6734
06:04:41,200 --> 06:04:45,400
RNA double standed

6735
06:04:45,520 --> 06:04:49,478
RNA then it forms small small mate was

6736
06:04:49,478 --> 06:04:51,760
being

6737
06:04:52,080 --> 06:04:55,360
cut right some other protein they also

6738
06:04:55,360 --> 06:04:57,958
joined them

6739
06:04:57,958 --> 06:05:02,160
and what they form is risk

6740
06:05:04,440 --> 06:05:06,760
complex risk

6741
06:05:06,760 --> 06:05:08,798
complex what is

6742
06:05:08,798 --> 06:05:13,878
this RNA induced silencing

6743
06:05:23,360 --> 06:05:28,638
complex RNA induced silencing complex

6744
06:05:28,638 --> 06:05:30,760
risk complex

6745
06:05:30,760 --> 06:05:34,680
clear now this risk right is there in a

6746
06:05:34,680 --> 06:05:37,280
plant now once nematode will come and

6747
06:05:37,280 --> 06:05:39,878
nematode will try to feed on this now

6748
06:05:39,878 --> 06:05:42,798
this risk

6749
06:05:42,798 --> 06:05:45,280
will

6750
06:05:45,280 --> 06:05:48,280
will

6751
06:05:48,520 --> 06:05:53,280
silence the vital

6752
06:05:54,798 --> 06:05:58,120
DNA of

6753
06:05:58,120 --> 06:06:01,400
mogy incognita

6754
06:06:01,400 --> 06:06:03,040
when

6755
06:06:03,040 --> 06:06:06,040
the

6756
06:06:06,240 --> 06:06:10,160
neod feed on

6757
06:06:14,638 --> 06:06:19,240
plant feed on plant is this point

6758
06:06:19,240 --> 06:06:22,080
clear yes or no come on tell

6759
06:06:22,080 --> 06:06:26,000
me still we have a long way to

6760
06:06:26,000 --> 06:06:29,000
go

6761
06:06:29,240 --> 06:06:32,440
come on come on tell

6762
06:06:36,920 --> 06:06:40,600
me okay not only this buddies we have

6763
06:06:40,600 --> 06:06:44,558
also created some other things what are

6764
06:06:44,558 --> 06:06:47,478
those we have also

6765
06:06:47,478 --> 06:06:52,280
created flavor saver variety of

6766
06:06:55,920 --> 06:06:58,920
tomato

6767
06:07:02,680 --> 06:07:06,360
where we have

6768
06:07:06,718 --> 06:07:11,080
silenced where we have silenced

6769
06:07:11,080 --> 06:07:14,080
poly

6770
06:07:14,600 --> 06:07:17,600
galao

6771
06:07:18,160 --> 06:07:21,120
urones

6772
06:07:21,120 --> 06:07:24,638
enzyme poly galacto urase enzyme we have

6773
06:07:24,638 --> 06:07:26,798
silence the poly galao urase enzyme and

6774
06:07:26,798 --> 06:07:29,558
this this particular enzyme is

6775
06:07:29,558 --> 06:07:31,478
responsible for

6776
06:07:31,478 --> 06:07:34,080
softening and if this enzyme is not

6777
06:07:34,080 --> 06:07:36,520
there there will no softening so this

6778
06:07:36,520 --> 06:07:41,958
helps in increasing the shelf life of

6779
06:07:48,878 --> 06:07:51,400
tomato clear flavor saver variety of

6780
06:07:51,400 --> 06:07:53,958
tomato now moving on to the next is what

6781
06:07:53,958 --> 06:07:58,638
we have created is golden rice

6782
06:07:58,638 --> 06:08:02,000
golden rice so golden rice is that Rice

6783
06:08:02,000 --> 06:08:05,360
which is rich in vitamin

6784
06:08:05,400 --> 06:08:11,160
A right where we have introduced Gene

6785
06:08:13,280 --> 06:08:19,558
of gene of beta

6786
06:08:19,638 --> 06:08:22,240
carotene which is a precursor of vitamin

6787
06:08:22,240 --> 06:08:25,798
A and that helps in curing the night

6788
06:08:25,798 --> 06:08:28,798
blindness

6789
06:08:29,360 --> 06:08:32,760
okay here

6790
06:08:32,760 --> 06:08:36,958
everyone yes or no come on tell

6791
06:08:40,280 --> 06:08:45,760
me yes okay now let's move towards the

6792
06:08:45,760 --> 06:08:48,080
application in medicine in medicines

6793
06:08:48,080 --> 06:08:51,478
also we have lot of applications the

6794
06:08:51,478 --> 06:08:53,798
first is uh only one thing is there in

6795
06:08:53,798 --> 06:08:55,920
your syllabus the first one is insulin

6796
06:08:55,920 --> 06:08:58,400
yes so we have created insulin Also

6797
06:08:58,400 --> 06:09:01,520
let's have a look so we have created

6798
06:09:01,520 --> 06:09:04,520
recombinate

6799
06:09:06,718 --> 06:09:10,320
insulin insulin so what is the function

6800
06:09:10,320 --> 06:09:13,200
of insulin what does insulin do in our

6801
06:09:13,200 --> 06:09:16,558
body insulin helps in reducing the blood

6802
06:09:16,558 --> 06:09:17,600
glucose

6803
06:09:17,600 --> 06:09:20,240
level right insulin reduces the blood

6804
06:09:20,240 --> 06:09:22,600
glucose level many people they suffer

6805
06:09:22,600 --> 06:09:26,120
from diabetes melittis not insipidus

6806
06:09:26,120 --> 06:09:29,680
diabetes Melius people they do not have

6807
06:09:29,680 --> 06:09:32,360
you know you know they they have a high

6808
06:09:32,360 --> 06:09:35,040
blood sugar level so they take insulin

6809
06:09:35,040 --> 06:09:36,160
from

6810
06:09:36,160 --> 06:09:39,760
outside is that clear so initially this

6811
06:09:39,760 --> 06:09:41,638
insulin was taken from a slaughtered

6812
06:09:41,638 --> 06:09:45,040
pigs cattles Etc but today we have

6813
06:09:45,040 --> 06:09:47,400
prepared recombinant insulin with us

6814
06:09:47,400 --> 06:09:50,520
which was prepared in 1983 by a company

6815
06:09:50,520 --> 06:09:51,760
named

6816
06:09:51,760 --> 06:09:55,638
Elly right by

6817
06:09:55,638 --> 06:09:58,638
Elly

6818
06:09:59,360 --> 06:10:01,360
in

6819
06:10:01,360 --> 06:10:04,360
1983

6820
06:10:04,520 --> 06:10:08,520
see insulin in our body is produced in

6821
06:10:08,520 --> 06:10:12,320
the form of a pro- insulin this is a

6822
06:10:12,320 --> 06:10:14,760
pro-

6823
06:10:16,718 --> 06:10:21,958
insulin right it is having different

6824
06:10:23,320 --> 06:10:28,638
chains this is a a chain

6825
06:10:29,558 --> 06:10:33,320
this is a b chain right a chain and B

6826
06:10:33,320 --> 06:10:35,360
chain let's label

6827
06:10:35,360 --> 06:10:39,958
this so this is a a

6828
06:10:39,958 --> 06:10:44,520
chain this is a c chain white in color

6829
06:10:44,520 --> 06:10:48,200
and pink one is a b chain these are the

6830
06:10:48,200 --> 06:10:49,400
different

6831
06:10:49,400 --> 06:10:52,360
chains right this is a pro insulin this

6832
06:10:52,360 --> 06:10:54,280
is how it is produced in our body so how

6833
06:10:54,280 --> 06:10:56,080
do the remain in this particular you

6834
06:10:56,080 --> 06:10:58,680
know this one because they are having

6835
06:10:58,680 --> 06:11:02,200
dulfi bonds like this because of the

6836
06:11:02,200 --> 06:11:06,000
dulfi bond because of dulfi bond they

6837
06:11:06,000 --> 06:11:09,240
remain like this now when this Pro

6838
06:11:09,240 --> 06:11:12,520
insulin is converted into an mature

6839
06:11:12,520 --> 06:11:15,200
insulin what we have

6840
06:11:15,200 --> 06:11:20,840
is this and this pink

6841
06:11:20,840 --> 06:11:25,558
one right and dulfi Bonds are

6842
06:11:25,558 --> 06:11:28,478
there

6843
06:11:28,478 --> 06:11:31,718
right a chain is made up of this one is

6844
06:11:31,718 --> 06:11:34,878
made up of 21 amino acid and this one is

6845
06:11:34,878 --> 06:11:37,000
made up of 30 amino acids it's a

6846
06:11:37,000 --> 06:11:40,878
polypeptide chain C now what scientist

6847
06:11:40,878 --> 06:11:45,240
did scientist took a CH

6848
06:11:45,240 --> 06:11:48,000
Gene a CH

6849
06:11:48,000 --> 06:11:52,120
Gene inserted into a

6850
06:11:52,360 --> 06:11:55,478
vector whose Vector name was

6851
06:11:55,478 --> 06:11:58,200
PBR

6852
06:11:58,200 --> 06:12:00,958
322 we have inserted

6853
06:12:00,958 --> 06:12:06,280
this Vector will transfer this into the

6854
06:12:07,040 --> 06:12:10,878
eal equoli may we transferred it and now

6855
06:12:10,878 --> 06:12:14,280
we have a we have

6856
06:12:15,638 --> 06:12:17,400
isolated

6857
06:12:17,400 --> 06:12:20,120
a

6858
06:12:20,120 --> 06:12:23,840
polypeptide so they did it

6859
06:12:23,840 --> 06:12:27,558
separately similarly scientists took B

6860
06:12:27,558 --> 06:12:29,958
chain

6861
06:12:31,840 --> 06:12:34,760
gene they isolated and they took this

6862
06:12:34,760 --> 06:12:36,680
and they inserted this into the vector

6863
06:12:36,680 --> 06:12:39,520
which is PBR

6864
06:12:42,558 --> 06:12:46,320
322 then they inserted into another eoli

6865
06:12:46,320 --> 06:12:50,558
cultured that eoli and then they

6866
06:12:50,558 --> 06:12:52,280
isolated

6867
06:12:52,280 --> 06:12:55,360
isolated B

6868
06:12:55,360 --> 06:12:58,360
polypeptide

6869
06:12:58,558 --> 06:13:00,638
and when they did

6870
06:13:00,638 --> 06:13:03,920
that later on they combined both of them

6871
06:13:03,920 --> 06:13:06,478
and today we have is recombinant insulin

6872
06:13:06,478 --> 06:13:08,680
with us what do we have is the

6873
06:13:08,680 --> 06:13:10,920
recombinant insulin with us so we have

6874
06:13:10,920 --> 06:13:15,638
created recombinant insulin here

6875
06:13:15,638 --> 06:13:18,638
here

6876
06:13:21,878 --> 06:13:23,760
okay

6877
06:13:23,760 --> 06:13:26,878
yes now next is gene therapy

6878
06:13:26,878 --> 06:13:30,840
y gene therapy gene therapy now this is

6879
06:13:30,840 --> 06:13:33,798
another application of biotechnology in

6880
06:13:33,798 --> 06:13:35,958
gene what is this gene therapy that

6881
06:13:35,958 --> 06:13:38,840
means we are therapizing the gene that

6882
06:13:38,840 --> 06:13:41,040
means we are replacing the faulty Gene

6883
06:13:41,040 --> 06:13:43,558
with a new Gene suppose in an human

6884
06:13:43,558 --> 06:13:45,920
suppose in a one particular person that

6885
06:13:45,920 --> 06:13:47,920
a one gene is not working what we will

6886
06:13:47,920 --> 06:13:49,760
do we will replace the faulty Gene so

6887
06:13:49,760 --> 06:13:52,958
gene therapy means What gene therapy

6888
06:13:52,958 --> 06:13:58,280
means sorry replace

6889
06:13:58,520 --> 06:14:02,040
the faulty

6890
06:14:02,040 --> 06:14:04,558
Gene faulty

6891
06:14:04,558 --> 06:14:07,400
gene

6892
06:14:07,400 --> 06:14:11,280
into oh sorry

6893
06:14:13,320 --> 06:14:17,000
with New

6894
06:14:17,000 --> 06:14:21,080
Gen New Gen so what we have done so far

6895
06:14:21,080 --> 06:14:24,360
see gene

6896
06:14:25,280 --> 06:14:28,120
therapy so there was a person if there

6897
06:14:28,120 --> 06:14:30,718
was a girl she was just a six year old

6898
06:14:30,718 --> 06:14:32,558
he was suffering from

6899
06:14:32,558 --> 06:14:36,400
skid skid

6900
06:14:37,400 --> 06:14:41,558
patient skid patient what is a skid skid

6901
06:14:41,558 --> 06:14:43,840
is

6902
06:14:43,840 --> 06:14:46,840
severe

6903
06:14:47,080 --> 06:14:51,200
combined immuno

6904
06:14:53,680 --> 06:14:58,718
deficiency severe combined immuno

6905
06:14:58,718 --> 06:15:02,200
deficiency skid patient right these

6906
06:15:02,200 --> 06:15:05,000
patient their immune system or their

6907
06:15:05,000 --> 06:15:07,718
immune is compromised they do not have a

6908
06:15:07,718 --> 06:15:10,600
yes aish so they have a immuno

6909
06:15:10,600 --> 06:15:13,760
compromised clear why because they are

6910
06:15:13,760 --> 06:15:15,600
not able to produce

6911
06:15:15,600 --> 06:15:20,878
adene no adenosine deaminase

6912
06:15:25,200 --> 06:15:28,200
enzyme

6913
06:15:29,798 --> 06:15:33,520
adenosine dmas

6914
06:15:33,520 --> 06:15:36,400
enzyme adenosine Damas enzyme is not

6915
06:15:36,400 --> 06:15:39,760
there when Ada is not there in them

6916
06:15:39,760 --> 06:15:42,878
because ad gen is

6917
06:15:42,878 --> 06:15:48,080
absent Ada Gene is absent and when I'm

6918
06:15:48,080 --> 06:15:51,160
saying Ada Gene is absent no enzyme and

6919
06:15:51,160 --> 06:15:53,120
this enzyme has a role and what is that

6920
06:15:53,120 --> 06:15:56,920
role so this help in

6921
06:15:56,920 --> 06:16:00,440
maturation of

6922
06:16:06,558 --> 06:16:12,440
WBC clear unti yes okay now what we have

6923
06:16:12,440 --> 06:16:17,280
done is we took out wbcs of the

6924
06:16:17,280 --> 06:16:19,920
patient so we took

6925
06:16:19,920 --> 06:16:24,920
out WBC of

6926
06:16:25,080 --> 06:16:27,000
patient

6927
06:16:27,000 --> 06:16:30,200
right we

6928
06:16:31,160 --> 06:16:34,840
inserted ad

6929
06:16:35,878 --> 06:16:40,878
Gene ad Gene in them we inserted ad Gene

6930
06:16:40,878 --> 06:16:41,798
in

6931
06:16:41,798 --> 06:16:47,320
them how with the help of

6932
06:16:47,840 --> 06:16:51,840
retrovirus disarmed retrovirus we took

6933
06:16:51,840 --> 06:16:54,638
and we have inserted this into it now

6934
06:16:54,638 --> 06:16:59,280
the next thing is reintroduction

6935
06:17:00,440 --> 06:17:03,958
of reintroduction

6936
06:17:03,958 --> 06:17:06,000
of

6937
06:17:06,000 --> 06:17:11,160
WBC into patient body now patient body

6938
06:17:11,160 --> 06:17:14,520
will start secreting ad

6939
06:17:16,160 --> 06:17:18,840
enzyme they will start secreting the ad

6940
06:17:18,840 --> 06:17:20,798
enzyme now ad enzyme is there but this

6941
06:17:20,798 --> 06:17:23,400
WBC has some life so one has to go

6942
06:17:23,400 --> 06:17:25,160
through this procedure again and again

6943
06:17:25,160 --> 06:17:26,840
so there are various therapies by which

6944
06:17:26,840 --> 06:17:28,840
we can treat one is a gene therapy it's

6945
06:17:28,840 --> 06:17:30,360
not a complete

6946
06:17:30,360 --> 06:17:33,840
treatment but Q means to say one has to

6947
06:17:33,840 --> 06:17:35,520
go through this again and again if this

6948
06:17:35,520 --> 06:17:37,840
could have been done at the embryo level

6949
06:17:37,840 --> 06:17:39,718
that would have been a permanent cure

6950
06:17:39,718 --> 06:17:41,240
but this is not a

6951
06:17:41,240 --> 06:17:43,958
permanent right buddies everybody is

6952
06:17:43,958 --> 06:17:45,360
this point

6953
06:17:45,360 --> 06:17:48,360
clear

6954
06:17:50,840 --> 06:17:56,878
okay okay so let's move on to the next

6955
06:17:56,878 --> 06:17:59,878
molecular

6956
06:18:01,798 --> 06:18:05,680
Diagnostics molecular

6957
06:18:10,040 --> 06:18:14,160
diagnostic yes so hope preparation is at

6958
06:18:14,160 --> 06:18:15,080
full

6959
06:18:15,080 --> 06:18:16,600
swing

6960
06:18:16,600 --> 06:18:19,680
right now moving on to the next is

6961
06:18:19,680 --> 06:18:22,440
moleular diagnostic molecular diagnostic

6962
06:18:22,440 --> 06:18:24,280
these are the you know we have

6963
06:18:24,280 --> 06:18:26,040
biotechnologies these are the ways of of

6964
06:18:26,040 --> 06:18:28,520
biotechnology and those biotechnology

6965
06:18:28,520 --> 06:18:32,120
things helps in the diagnosis of various

6966
06:18:32,120 --> 06:18:34,878
diseases either it is you know your

6967
06:18:34,878 --> 06:18:37,160
cancer cancer detection can be possible

6968
06:18:37,160 --> 06:18:39,558
that I'll show you how even when there

6969
06:18:39,558 --> 06:18:41,878
is any genetic disorder that is also

6970
06:18:41,878 --> 06:18:44,000
detected with the help of this in a

6971
06:18:44,000 --> 06:18:46,958
conventional method when we have is a

6972
06:18:46,958 --> 06:18:51,000
blood test uh urine test tool test in

6973
06:18:51,000 --> 06:18:53,878
that case the uh you know the disease

6974
06:18:53,878 --> 06:18:56,400
can be detected when symptoms are there

6975
06:18:56,400 --> 06:18:58,320
in the blood and already symptoms are

6976
06:18:58,320 --> 06:19:01,360
there but these are the ways by which

6977
06:19:01,360 --> 06:19:03,558
pre sympto symptomatic that means before

6978
06:19:03,558 --> 06:19:05,520
symptom also we can easily detect

6979
06:19:05,520 --> 06:19:07,320
whether person is suffering from any

6980
06:19:07,320 --> 06:19:09,320
disease or not even cancer can be

6981
06:19:09,320 --> 06:19:11,478
detected even whether person is HIV

6982
06:19:11,478 --> 06:19:12,920
positive or not that can also be

6983
06:19:12,920 --> 06:19:14,680
detected any genetic disorder is there

6984
06:19:14,680 --> 06:19:16,478
or not that can also be detected by this

6985
06:19:16,478 --> 06:19:18,840
that I'll show you so here the molecular

6986
06:19:18,840 --> 06:19:20,638
diagnostic three different procedure are

6987
06:19:20,638 --> 06:19:22,798
there one is a

6988
06:19:22,798 --> 06:19:24,840
PCR

6989
06:19:24,840 --> 06:19:28,680
okay so one is a

6990
06:19:28,680 --> 06:19:31,760
PCR PCR how does a PCR function that

6991
06:19:31,760 --> 06:19:33,798
I've discussed with you isn't it

6992
06:19:33,798 --> 06:19:35,760
polymerase chain reaction that is used

6993
06:19:35,760 --> 06:19:36,798
for

6994
06:19:36,798 --> 06:19:38,958
amplification the first thing is with

6995
06:19:38,958 --> 06:19:43,718
this we can identify any genetic

6996
06:19:44,920 --> 06:19:47,920
disorder

6997
06:19:48,000 --> 06:19:50,760
identify

6998
06:19:50,760 --> 06:19:57,080
any genetic disorder very much possible

6999
06:19:57,080 --> 06:20:00,798
right any change in the gene sequence

7000
06:20:00,798 --> 06:20:02,558
any change is there in the gene sequence

7001
06:20:02,558 --> 06:20:06,440
we can easily detect them isn't it yes

7002
06:20:06,440 --> 06:20:10,200
now the next thing is HIV even when

7003
06:20:10,200 --> 06:20:12,680
there is low concentration of pathogen

7004
06:20:12,680 --> 06:20:15,160
can be easily

7005
06:20:15,160 --> 06:20:19,120
detected low concentration

7006
06:20:19,120 --> 06:20:20,760
of

7007
06:20:20,760 --> 06:20:24,718
pathogen can also be

7008
06:20:24,718 --> 06:20:27,718
detected

7009
06:20:28,558 --> 06:20:32,360
be detected for example you remember uh

7010
06:20:32,360 --> 06:20:35,840
covid test rtpcr was used so that is

7011
06:20:35,840 --> 06:20:37,040
also

7012
06:20:37,040 --> 06:20:40,920
same yes rooster extension HIV yes HIV

7013
06:20:40,920 --> 06:20:43,478
can also be detected asish rooster yes

7014
06:20:43,478 --> 06:20:45,680
that can also be

7015
06:20:45,680 --> 06:20:49,520
detected now next thing is mutation can

7016
06:20:49,520 --> 06:20:51,840
be

7017
06:20:51,920 --> 06:20:54,400
detected

7018
06:20:54,400 --> 06:20:59,160
mutation can can be

7019
06:20:59,478 --> 06:21:01,558
detected

7020
06:21:01,558 --> 06:21:04,040
in

7021
06:21:04,040 --> 06:21:07,040
cancer

7022
06:21:08,400 --> 06:21:11,400
suspected

7023
06:21:12,840 --> 06:21:16,320
patients cancer suspected patient

7024
06:21:16,320 --> 06:21:21,520
PCR clear because whenever any change is

7025
06:21:21,840 --> 06:21:24,240
there yes rooster I'm teaching for the

7026
06:21:24,240 --> 06:21:26,440
boards it's for boards Marathon

7027
06:21:26,440 --> 06:21:29,440
on

7028
06:21:31,920 --> 06:21:35,638
now now next one second one is auto

7029
06:21:35,638 --> 06:21:39,000
radiography second

7030
06:21:39,040 --> 06:21:40,958
Point

7031
06:21:40,958 --> 06:21:43,240
Auto

7032
06:21:43,240 --> 06:21:46,240
radio

7033
06:21:47,798 --> 06:21:50,638
graphy Auto radiography now what is a

7034
06:21:50,638 --> 06:21:52,920
auto radiography in Auto radiography we

7035
06:21:52,920 --> 06:21:55,840
use radio labeled probe that is a sing

7036
06:21:55,840 --> 06:22:01,040
standard DNA or RNA so what we use is we

7037
06:22:01,040 --> 06:22:04,680
use radio

7038
06:22:07,000 --> 06:22:10,680
labeled single

7039
06:22:13,920 --> 06:22:15,600
stranded

7040
06:22:15,600 --> 06:22:19,160
probe and this can be a DNA or RNA

7041
06:22:19,160 --> 06:22:20,840
always remember students they come to me

7042
06:22:20,840 --> 06:22:23,840
and they say ma'am it is only DNA no it

7043
06:22:23,840 --> 06:22:26,400
can be a DNA and RNA now just imagine

7044
06:22:26,400 --> 06:22:29,120
buddies if your DNA is Radio

7045
06:22:29,120 --> 06:22:32,120
labeled

7046
06:22:32,958 --> 06:22:36,638
right if it is Dian is Radio labeled it

7047
06:22:36,638 --> 06:22:40,718
can easily bind to

7048
06:22:40,840 --> 06:22:45,920
complimentary can bind

7049
06:22:45,920 --> 06:22:48,920
to

7050
06:22:49,360 --> 06:22:52,360
complimentary

7051
06:22:52,840 --> 06:22:55,120
DNA right it can go go and B to the

7052
06:22:55,120 --> 06:23:00,440
compliment DNA then it will show the

7053
06:23:00,718 --> 06:23:02,760
radioactivity

7054
06:23:02,760 --> 06:23:06,200
radioactivity visible and it if doesn't

7055
06:23:06,200 --> 06:23:08,920
bind so that means if mutation is

7056
06:23:08,920 --> 06:23:11,280
there it doesn't bind that means some

7057
06:23:11,280 --> 06:23:12,958
mutation is there in our DNA that is the

7058
06:23:12,958 --> 06:23:15,360
reason it is not able to

7059
06:23:15,360 --> 06:23:20,000
bind so what is the use use is any

7060
06:23:20,000 --> 06:23:22,520
disease can be detected if this is

7061
06:23:22,520 --> 06:23:26,000
because of mutation in the DNA is this

7062
06:23:26,000 --> 06:23:28,638
point clear now moving on to the last

7063
06:23:28,638 --> 06:23:31,718
one that is the

7064
06:23:33,080 --> 06:23:35,600
Elisa third

7065
06:23:35,600 --> 06:23:38,080
one third

7066
06:23:38,080 --> 06:23:41,760
one is

7067
06:23:41,958 --> 06:23:47,040
Elisa what is Elisa Elisa is

7068
06:23:47,040 --> 06:23:49,840
enzyme

7069
06:23:49,840 --> 06:23:52,840
linked

7070
06:23:54,400 --> 06:23:57,400
immuno

7071
06:23:59,360 --> 06:24:02,360
sorbent

7072
06:24:02,400 --> 06:24:06,320
saay enzyme linked immunosorbent essay

7073
06:24:06,320 --> 06:24:11,000
Eliza enzyme linked immunosorbent

7074
06:24:11,000 --> 06:24:13,478
essay

7075
06:24:13,478 --> 06:24:16,280
okay okay now what is this enzyme linked

7076
06:24:16,280 --> 06:24:19,200
immunosorbent essay now here this is

7077
06:24:19,200 --> 06:24:23,400
based on antigen antibody

7078
06:24:24,360 --> 06:24:25,920
reaction

7079
06:24:25,920 --> 06:24:28,920
antibody

7080
06:24:29,958 --> 06:24:32,558
reaction now suppose suppose in

7081
06:24:32,558 --> 06:24:35,120
someone's body any suppose an any

7082
06:24:35,120 --> 06:24:38,320
antigen is there right let's say in X

7083
06:24:38,320 --> 06:24:42,440
body some HIV positive antigen virus is

7084
06:24:42,440 --> 06:24:44,200
there anything any bacteria is there

7085
06:24:44,200 --> 06:24:46,000
something is there some antigen is there

7086
06:24:46,000 --> 06:24:48,400
now what will happen we will add we will

7087
06:24:48,400 --> 06:24:50,958
take a sample blood sample we will add

7088
06:24:50,958 --> 06:24:53,600
antibodies and those antibodies they

7089
06:24:53,600 --> 06:24:55,558
will bind to the antigen they will go

7090
06:24:55,558 --> 06:24:58,200
and they will bind to the antigen clear

7091
06:24:58,200 --> 06:25:00,120
as they will bind to the antigen so

7092
06:25:00,120 --> 06:25:02,400
antigen antibody complex will be there

7093
06:25:02,400 --> 06:25:04,840
extra we will wash it then we will use

7094
06:25:04,840 --> 06:25:06,878
another antibodies and that antibody

7095
06:25:06,878 --> 06:25:09,160
will be radio labeled antibody will come

7096
06:25:09,160 --> 06:25:11,400
and antibody will bind to the antibody

7097
06:25:11,400 --> 06:25:13,558
again so there will be antibody antibody

7098
06:25:13,558 --> 06:25:16,280
and antigen complex that antibody will

7099
06:25:16,280 --> 06:25:18,718
start eliminating radioactivity as as

7100
06:25:18,718 --> 06:25:20,558
they will radiate the radioactivity that

7101
06:25:20,558 --> 06:25:22,240
means the positive that means that

7102
06:25:22,240 --> 06:25:24,280
particular antigen is

7103
06:25:24,280 --> 06:25:28,958
there done clear so that is Elisa it is

7104
06:25:28,958 --> 06:25:31,718
based on antigen antibody

7105
06:25:31,718 --> 06:25:34,558
reaction so moving on to the next is

7106
06:25:34,558 --> 06:25:36,840
transgenic animal biotechnology because

7107
06:25:36,840 --> 06:25:38,360
of the biotechnology today we have

7108
06:25:38,360 --> 06:25:41,718
created transgenic animals also now

7109
06:25:41,718 --> 06:25:44,400
there are animals whose genome has been

7110
06:25:44,400 --> 06:25:46,400
altered by introduction of a foreign

7111
06:25:46,400 --> 06:25:48,400
Gene by manipulation that is a

7112
06:25:48,400 --> 06:25:50,000
transgenic animal so there's a

7113
06:25:50,000 --> 06:25:51,718
difference cloning is something else

7114
06:25:51,718 --> 06:25:53,240
this is a

7115
06:25:53,240 --> 06:25:57,200
transgenic right yes Rose

7116
06:25:57,360 --> 06:26:02,240
huh now transgenic rat rabbit pigs sheep

7117
06:26:02,240 --> 06:26:04,638
cows fish over

7118
06:26:04,638 --> 06:26:08,760
95% of transgenic animals are the

7119
06:26:08,760 --> 06:26:11,920
mice okay so why we have created mice

7120
06:26:11,920 --> 06:26:14,920
let's have a

7121
06:26:20,798 --> 06:26:23,000
look

7122
06:26:23,000 --> 06:26:27,320
okay yeah we were here here okay let's

7123
06:26:27,320 --> 06:26:30,718
see have a look trenic animals today we

7124
06:26:30,718 --> 06:26:32,840
have created so that we can study the

7125
06:26:32,840 --> 06:26:34,400
normal physiology and development

7126
06:26:34,400 --> 06:26:37,558
suppose I want to study a gene right and

7127
06:26:37,558 --> 06:26:39,920
I have introduced suppose some X Gene is

7128
06:26:39,920 --> 06:26:41,638
there in human body and I want to study

7129
06:26:41,638 --> 06:26:44,080
that Gene how does that Gene function

7130
06:26:44,080 --> 06:26:45,878
how does it is transcribe and translate

7131
06:26:45,878 --> 06:26:48,200
I will insert that Gene into a rise and

7132
06:26:48,200 --> 06:26:49,920
I can easily study it into a mice I

7133
06:26:49,920 --> 06:26:52,080
cannot study into a human body very

7134
06:26:52,080 --> 06:26:54,680
difficult but majorly it is done in case

7135
06:26:54,680 --> 06:26:56,798
of a mice nice to study the contribution

7136
06:26:56,798 --> 06:26:59,638
of gene in development of disease clear

7137
06:26:59,638 --> 06:27:02,718
next is biological product today human

7138
06:27:02,718 --> 06:27:05,718
protein alpha 1 antipin used to treat

7139
06:27:05,718 --> 06:27:08,638
micma product treatment of Phile Ketone

7140
06:27:08,638 --> 06:27:10,878
Uria and cystic fibrosis also we have

7141
06:27:10,878 --> 06:27:14,040
created see all thanks to biotechnology

7142
06:27:14,040 --> 06:27:17,440
1997 Rosie the first transgenic

7143
06:27:17,440 --> 06:27:20,958
cow I'm saying the transgenic cow I'm

7144
06:27:20,958 --> 06:27:22,520
not saying the cloned cloned is

7145
06:27:22,520 --> 06:27:24,600
something else this is transgenic so

7146
06:27:24,600 --> 06:27:25,798
that means we have we have inserted a

7147
06:27:25,798 --> 06:27:29,280
gene from outside we have uh this is the

7148
06:27:29,280 --> 06:27:31,600
transited cow which produces milk which

7149
06:27:31,600 --> 06:27:36,120
is rich in protein that is 2.4 G per

7150
06:27:36,120 --> 06:27:40,000
liter and that is Alpha lactal albumine

7151
06:27:40,000 --> 06:27:42,160
and it's nutritionally more balanced

7152
06:27:42,160 --> 06:27:44,280
product for human babies than a natural

7153
06:27:44,280 --> 06:27:46,360
cow milk definitely there is no

7154
06:27:46,360 --> 06:27:49,520
alternative to a mother's milk but this

7155
06:27:49,520 --> 06:27:53,558
milk is better for babies as compared to

7156
06:27:53,558 --> 06:27:55,360
a normal milk I'm not saying the

7157
06:27:55,360 --> 06:27:57,920
mother's milk mother's milk is best and

7158
06:27:57,920 --> 06:28:01,520
then we have is this one vaccine safety

7159
06:28:01,520 --> 06:28:03,718
you all know vaccine trials and

7160
06:28:03,718 --> 06:28:05,600
everything happens on mice and other

7161
06:28:05,600 --> 06:28:08,200
animals chemical safing whatever

7162
06:28:08,200 --> 06:28:10,280
chemicals whatever you know the face

7163
06:28:10,280 --> 06:28:12,840
product whatever Cosmetics we use they

7164
06:28:12,840 --> 06:28:16,840
are always tried and tested on

7165
06:28:21,160 --> 06:28:23,080
animals

7166
06:28:23,080 --> 06:28:26,120
okay now

7167
06:28:26,120 --> 06:28:29,600
ethical issues problem of unpredictable

7168
06:28:29,600 --> 06:28:31,320
result genetic modification may cause

7169
06:28:31,320 --> 06:28:33,440
unpredictable result when such organism

7170
06:28:33,440 --> 06:28:34,878
are introduced into the ecosystem

7171
06:28:34,878 --> 06:28:36,280
because they're natural Predators they

7172
06:28:36,280 --> 06:28:38,520
are absent that is a reason Indian

7173
06:28:38,520 --> 06:28:40,080
government has set up an organization

7174
06:28:40,080 --> 06:28:41,958
which is a GAC genetic engineering

7175
06:28:41,958 --> 06:28:45,080
approval committee which makes decision

7176
06:28:45,080 --> 06:28:48,558
regarding at what extent modification

7177
06:28:48,558 --> 06:28:51,478
can be done make decision about the

7178
06:28:51,478 --> 06:28:54,240
validity of the GM research and the

7179
06:28:54,240 --> 06:28:57,680
safety of GM organism for public

7180
06:28:57,680 --> 06:29:02,638
services clear now

7181
06:29:02,638 --> 06:29:06,280
yes problems of patent unpredictable

7182
06:29:06,280 --> 06:29:07,840
result may be observed by introduction

7183
06:29:07,840 --> 06:29:09,600
of these organism in

7184
06:29:09,600 --> 06:29:12,240
ecosystem many indigenous varieties are

7185
06:29:12,240 --> 06:29:14,718
claimed by the mnc's as their own

7186
06:29:14,718 --> 06:29:16,478
invention that is also one of the

7187
06:29:16,478 --> 06:29:18,638
problem here comes an example of a

7188
06:29:18,638 --> 06:29:21,558
Basmati you all know Indian literature

7189
06:29:21,558 --> 06:29:23,520
is full of Basmati because of their

7190
06:29:23,520 --> 06:29:27,520
Aroma we are using Basmati from ages but

7191
06:29:27,520 --> 06:29:30,240
what this country did let's have a look

7192
06:29:30,240 --> 06:29:33,040
now there's an American company American

7193
06:29:33,040 --> 06:29:35,920
company patented the Basmati now what

7194
06:29:35,920 --> 06:29:38,440
they did is they took just a Indian

7195
06:29:38,440 --> 06:29:41,120
variety normal Indian variety basmati

7196
06:29:41,120 --> 06:29:43,600
rice and they crossed it with the semi

7197
06:29:43,600 --> 06:29:47,200
dwarf varieties and they said K this

7198
06:29:47,200 --> 06:29:49,798
belongs to us which was a biggest issue

7199
06:29:49,798 --> 06:29:52,840
so now it has been rectified similarly

7200
06:29:52,840 --> 06:29:55,160
other medicine usage are also there such

7201
06:29:55,160 --> 06:29:57,878
as neem as a directa indicia the

7202
06:29:57,878 --> 06:29:59,680
turmeric use which we are using from the

7203
06:29:59,680 --> 06:30:03,600
a ages and their antibacterial

7204
06:30:04,000 --> 06:30:07,440
properties biopiracy what is biopiracy

7205
06:30:07,440 --> 06:30:09,520
if this this can be asked one marker

7206
06:30:09,520 --> 06:30:13,120
Buddies the use of Bio Resources by MNC

7207
06:30:13,120 --> 06:30:15,120
and other organization without proper

7208
06:30:15,120 --> 06:30:16,478
authorization suppose you have

7209
06:30:16,478 --> 06:30:17,920
discovered something either it is a

7210
06:30:17,920 --> 06:30:20,478
process or anything and

7211
06:30:20,478 --> 06:30:23,000
buddies without proper authorization

7212
06:30:23,000 --> 06:30:25,000
from the countries then this is is

7213
06:30:25,000 --> 06:30:27,638
termed as biopiracy Indian Parliament

7214
06:30:27,638 --> 06:30:29,080
has recently introduced a second

7215
06:30:29,080 --> 06:30:31,080
amendment of The Indian patent Bill to

7216
06:30:31,080 --> 06:30:33,680
deal with such

7217
06:30:33,680 --> 06:30:37,120
issues yes so soon if you will patent

7218
06:30:37,120 --> 06:30:40,200
something you will get you know that

7219
06:30:40,200 --> 06:30:42,958
thingy no one can use it until unless

7220
06:30:42,958 --> 06:30:46,280
you give them author authoritie should

7221
06:30:46,280 --> 06:30:47,638
have that

7222
06:30:47,638 --> 06:30:49,878
Authority or they should give you some

7223
06:30:49,878 --> 06:30:53,120
compensatory payment okay now butes we

7224
06:30:53,120 --> 06:30:54,520
have to start another chapter which is a

7225
06:30:54,520 --> 06:30:56,240

so yes the content is there along with

7269
06:53:11,958 --> 06:53:13,558
the diagrams are also there like

7270
06:53:13,558 --> 06:53:16,718
antibody diagram the life cycle of HIV

7271
06:53:16,718 --> 06:53:19,360
that is also important okay come on

start now what is health health is

7276
06:53:31,040 --> 06:53:33,558
defined as the state of complete

7277
06:53:33,558 --> 06:53:35,920
physical mental and social well-being

7278
06:53:35,920 --> 06:53:37,680
this is a general definition given by

7279
06:53:37,680 --> 06:53:41,478
the wh you should not only be uh you

7280
06:53:41,478 --> 06:53:43,160
know there should not be any disease so

7281
06:53:43,160 --> 06:53:45,280
along with the disease you should not be

7282
06:53:45,280 --> 06:53:48,398
uh you know mentally uh unhealthy your

7283
06:53:48,398 --> 06:53:49,920
your thinking should be good you should

7284
06:53:49,920 --> 06:53:53,878
be all positive because nowadays uh you

7285
06:53:53,878 --> 06:53:56,760
all know we are more aware of the you

7286
06:53:56,760 --> 06:53:57,920
know mental

7287
06:53:57,920 --> 06:54:00,520
disorders we should also think about

7288
06:54:00,520 --> 06:54:03,240
what uh actually goes in our mind either

7289
06:54:03,240 --> 06:54:05,160
we are positive towards other or we are

7290
06:54:05,160 --> 06:54:08,120
very negative or what we think that also

7291
06:54:08,120 --> 06:54:11,080
matters now so we should be mentally

7292
06:54:11,080 --> 06:54:12,920
healthy and as well as the people who

7293
06:54:12,920 --> 06:54:14,558
arounds you they should be good they

7294
06:54:14,558 --> 06:54:18,360
should be helpful now health is being

7295
06:54:18,360 --> 06:54:20,320
affected by the genetic disorder there

7296
06:54:20,320 --> 06:54:22,080
are various disorder by which health is

7297
06:54:22,080 --> 06:54:24,000
affected like lifestyle also affects it

7298
06:54:24,000 --> 06:54:26,200
whatever you eat that also affect it

7299
06:54:26,200 --> 06:54:28,398
wide range of organisms like bacteria

7300
06:54:28,398 --> 06:54:31,600
fungus virus protozoa helth also affects

7301
06:54:31,600 --> 06:54:33,040
our

7302
06:54:33,040 --> 06:54:35,718
life isn't it

7303
06:54:35,718 --> 06:54:38,958
yes okay if you have any doubt guys you

7304
06:54:38,958 --> 06:54:40,920
can ask in the comment section keep

7305
06:54:40,920 --> 06:54:43,558
asking I looking at the comment sections

7306
06:54:43,558 --> 06:54:46,478
also okay now let's talk about the types

7307
06:54:46,478 --> 06:54:49,080
of diseases we classify diseases into

7308
06:54:49,080 --> 06:54:50,718
this category the first one is a

7309
06:54:50,718 --> 06:54:52,760
communicate or the communicable diseases

7310
06:54:52,760 --> 06:54:54,398
these are the infectious diseases which

7311
06:54:54,398 --> 06:54:57,280
spread from one person to another and

7312
06:54:57,280 --> 06:54:58,920
the second one is a non-communicable

7313
06:54:58,920 --> 06:55:00,520
diseases which doesn't spread from one

7314
06:55:00,520 --> 06:55:03,718
person to another now one communicable

7315
06:55:03,718 --> 06:55:05,478
or non-communicable diseases are those

7316
06:55:05,478 --> 06:55:08,680
diseases which develop after birth so

7317
06:55:08,680 --> 06:55:10,440
they're not congenital these are the

7318
06:55:10,440 --> 06:55:13,520
acquired one which we acquire when we

7319
06:55:13,520 --> 06:55:15,360
are Expos when we are exposed to

7320
06:55:15,360 --> 06:55:17,680
different uh you know bacteria fungus

7321
06:55:17,680 --> 06:55:19,360
pathogen we develop these diseases

7322
06:55:19,360 --> 06:55:21,120
sometime we spread those diseases from

7323
06:55:21,120 --> 06:55:22,878
one person to another sometime we not do

7324
06:55:22,878 --> 06:55:25,958
not they're caused by the virus bacteria

7325
06:55:25,958 --> 06:55:29,120
fungus protozoa and

7326
06:55:29,120 --> 06:55:32,520
helmin right they are caused by the

7327
06:55:32,520 --> 06:55:35,320
deficiency of nutrient hormone

7328
06:55:35,320 --> 06:55:38,200
degeneration of body organs allergy uh

7329
06:55:38,200 --> 06:55:40,920
cancer Etc comes under this category if

7330
06:55:40,920 --> 06:55:43,478
I talk about the congenital congenital

7331
06:55:43,478 --> 06:55:47,600
are those which are present from

7332
06:55:48,240 --> 06:55:54,520
birth present from birth

7333
06:55:54,600 --> 06:55:57,600
present from birth right now these are

7334
06:55:57,600 --> 06:55:59,478
genetic disorders genetic disorders are

7335
06:55:59,478 --> 06:56:02,280
the one which are present from birth now

7336
06:56:02,280 --> 06:56:04,120
anatomical or physiological

7337
06:56:04,120 --> 06:56:06,558
abnormalities present from birth can be

7338
06:56:06,558 --> 06:56:08,718
caused by single demodulation for

7339
06:56:08,718 --> 06:56:10,798
example hemophilia color blindness Phile

7340
06:56:10,798 --> 06:56:13,398
Kone UA sickle cell anemia chromosomal

7341
06:56:13,398 --> 06:56:17,680
libration like down syndrome ROM of

7342
06:56:17,680 --> 06:56:20,280
chromosome number 21 the Turner syndrome

7343
06:56:20,280 --> 06:56:21,920
clein filter syndrome environmental

7344
06:56:21,920 --> 06:56:23,958
factors like hair clip and the cleft

7345
06:56:23,958 --> 06:56:27,320
pallet so they come under this category

7346
06:56:27,320 --> 06:56:29,718
yes

7347
06:56:29,718 --> 06:56:34,600
okay any doubt why are you guys

7348
06:56:40,080 --> 06:56:43,000
fighting yes definitely nobama I can

7349
06:56:43,000 --> 06:56:45,600
repeat that again you mean to say this

7350
06:56:45,600 --> 06:56:48,360
point so here those diseases are those

7351
06:56:48,360 --> 06:56:50,200
these are the diseases which doesn't

7352
06:56:50,200 --> 06:56:51,798
which are congenital that means these

7353
06:56:51,798 --> 06:56:54,360
are the one which are present from birth

7354
06:56:54,360 --> 06:56:56,680
right caused by the single demodulation

7355
06:56:56,680 --> 06:56:58,638
that means any changes in the chromosome

7356
06:56:58,638 --> 06:57:00,520
suppose there's a triome of chromosome

7357
06:57:00,520 --> 06:57:02,840
number 21 what do we call that that is

7358
06:57:02,840 --> 06:57:06,080
uh Down syndrome Turner syndrome EXO

7359
06:57:06,080 --> 06:57:09,200
color blindness the you know hemophilia

7360
06:57:09,200 --> 06:57:11,558
Phile ketonuria sickle cell anemia comes

7361
06:57:11,558 --> 06:57:15,760
under this category and then we have is

7362
06:57:17,478 --> 06:57:22,440
disol okay okay no no Bama clear okay

7363
06:57:22,440 --> 06:57:27,120
okay so let's start further now diseases

7364
06:57:27,120 --> 06:57:30,160
now diseases in your chapter is there

7365
06:57:30,160 --> 06:57:32,200
some diseases are in detail some are not

7366
06:57:32,200 --> 06:57:33,920
detailed so I have made a chart of it

7367
06:57:33,920 --> 06:57:36,718
and with the help of a chart let's

7368
06:57:36,718 --> 06:57:38,958
understand everything first let's talk

7369
06:57:38,958 --> 06:57:41,600
about typhoid so

7370
06:57:41,600 --> 06:57:45,718
typhoid ctive agent is salmona Ty muum

7371
06:57:45,718 --> 06:57:48,638
what is that that is the

7372
06:57:48,638 --> 06:57:51,320
salbon one

7373
06:57:51,320 --> 06:57:52,958
second

7374
06:57:52,958 --> 06:57:56,440
okay so that is the salmonella triim

7375
06:57:56,440 --> 06:57:59,718
muum so salmonella trium this is the

7376
06:57:59,718 --> 06:58:02,478
inhabitant of the small intestine how

7377
06:58:02,478 --> 06:58:04,798
does it spread whenever we use outside

7378
06:58:04,798 --> 06:58:07,760
food during especially during the you

7379
06:58:07,760 --> 06:58:09,600
know the rainy season when the moisture

7380
06:58:09,600 --> 06:58:12,120
is high temperature is high at that

7381
06:58:12,120 --> 06:58:15,558
particular time typhoid cases comes now

7382
06:58:15,558 --> 06:58:17,600
how does it enter it generally enter

7383
06:58:17,600 --> 06:58:19,280
through the small intestine through the

7384
06:58:19,280 --> 06:58:22,000
food water contaminated with bacteria

7385
06:58:22,000 --> 06:58:24,000
and migrate to other organs through the

7386
06:58:24,000 --> 06:58:26,760
blood they can cause perforation in the

7387
06:58:26,760 --> 06:58:28,878
small intestine due to which person

7388
06:58:28,878 --> 06:58:32,760
feels pain lot of pain right the fever

7389
06:58:32,760 --> 06:58:35,798
here goes very high a person feel high

7390
06:58:35,798 --> 06:58:40,280
fever chills right so classic case you

7391
06:58:40,280 --> 06:58:42,798
all know the Mary Malon which who was a

7392
06:58:42,798 --> 06:58:44,798
cook by profession he was having this

7393
06:58:44,798 --> 06:58:46,280
problem he was continuously cooking and

7394
06:58:46,280 --> 06:58:48,920
he was spreading the disease also so the

7395
06:58:48,920 --> 06:58:52,398
symptom is sustained high fever 39 to

7396
06:58:52,398 --> 06:58:54,680
40° cus weakness stomach pain

7397
06:58:54,680 --> 06:58:57,120
constipation headache loss of appetite

7398
06:58:57,120 --> 06:58:59,320
intestinal perforation and it also keys

7399
06:58:59,320 --> 06:59:00,200
to

7400
06:59:00,200 --> 06:59:03,558
death clear one of the most important

7401
06:59:03,558 --> 06:59:04,878
question which can be asked from this

7402
06:59:04,878 --> 06:59:08,478
topic is the uh you know

7403
06:59:08,478 --> 06:59:13,120
uh the test the Vidal test yes Vidal

7404
06:59:13,120 --> 06:59:15,440
test it measure the utenation of

7405
06:59:15,440 --> 06:59:17,558
antibodies against ho antigen of the

7406
06:59:17,558 --> 06:59:20,798
sanilla tyy this is if vial test we are

7407
06:59:20,798 --> 06:59:22,000
talking about that means we are talking

7408
06:59:22,000 --> 06:59:25,920
about the Sala tyum or the Ty typhoid

7409
06:59:25,920 --> 06:59:29,600
okay okay okie dokie so let's start so

7410
06:59:29,600 --> 06:59:32,000
this is a typhoid now let's move on to

7411
06:59:32,000 --> 06:59:35,320
the next one next disease we have is

7412
06:59:35,320 --> 06:59:39,040
pneumonia pneumonia so the pneumonia

7413
06:59:39,040 --> 06:59:41,120
basically it affects the alali of the

7414
06:59:41,120 --> 06:59:43,478
lung so person is not able to breathe

7415
06:59:43,478 --> 06:59:46,200
properly here the costive agent is

7416
06:59:46,200 --> 06:59:49,280
streptococus neumonia hemophilus influen

7417
06:59:49,280 --> 06:59:51,718
both of them you have to learn because

7418
06:59:51,718 --> 06:59:55,760
given your ncrt Alvi it affects the Alvi

7419
06:59:55,760 --> 06:59:59,280
of the lungs what is this bacterial yes

7420
06:59:59,280 --> 07:00:01,840
this is a bacterial disorder now

7421
07:00:01,840 --> 07:00:04,478
inhaling the droplet aerosole released

7422
07:00:04,478 --> 07:00:06,280
by The Infected person by sharing

7423
07:00:06,280 --> 07:00:08,240
glasses utensil of affected person if

7424
07:00:08,240 --> 07:00:10,920
one person is affected affecting and

7425
07:00:10,920 --> 07:00:12,840
another person can also have this if

7426
07:00:12,840 --> 07:00:16,120
they share the utensils needles

7427
07:00:16,120 --> 07:00:18,680
Etc here what happens is these are the

7428
07:00:18,680 --> 07:00:21,680
alval alval they are filled with fluid

7429
07:00:21,680 --> 07:00:25,000
due to to which the oxygen the gases

7430
07:00:25,000 --> 07:00:27,398
transport area reduces person feel

7431
07:00:27,398 --> 07:00:30,040
suffocated they're not able to breathe

7432
07:00:30,040 --> 07:00:33,160
properly so Alvi filled with fluid

7433
07:00:33,160 --> 07:00:36,200
leading to prop uh problems related to

7434
07:00:36,200 --> 07:00:40,120
respiration here fever chills scff and

7435
07:00:40,120 --> 07:00:43,440
headache severe cases the nails and the

7436
07:00:43,440 --> 07:00:47,040
skin turns blue lips

7437
07:00:47,040 --> 07:00:50,080
finger grayish to bluish in color why

7438
07:00:50,080 --> 07:00:52,280
because of lack of oxygen because of

7439
07:00:52,280 --> 07:00:56,240
less oxygen isn't it now can be detected

7440
07:00:56,240 --> 07:00:59,000
by the blood test x-ray plus pulse

7441
07:00:59,000 --> 07:01:03,040
oximetry and the sputum test next is

7442
07:01:03,040 --> 07:01:06,760
dentry dentry by the shagala species it

7443
07:01:06,760 --> 07:01:08,558
affects the intestine whenever we

7444
07:01:08,558 --> 07:01:11,718
consume outside food so we can suffer

7445
07:01:11,718 --> 07:01:15,440
from uh dentry now your exams are near

7446
07:01:15,440 --> 07:01:17,040
here your apping for your board

examination so make sure you oid outside

7450
07:01:22,958 --> 07:01:25,440
food for at least this period of time

7451
07:01:25,440 --> 07:01:27,520
now contaminated food you know the

7452
07:01:27,520 --> 07:01:29,000
temperature also if I talk about if

7453
07:01:29,000 --> 07:01:30,840
you're from the north India temperature

7454
07:01:30,840 --> 07:01:33,398
is going high so please take care of

7455
07:01:33,398 --> 07:01:35,398
yourself right now also like it goes to

7456
07:01:35,398 --> 07:01:38,600
30° C here even in the month of March

7457
07:01:38,600 --> 07:01:41,520
which is really high now pain in the

7458
07:01:41,520 --> 07:01:43,558
abdomen diarrhea IND digestion nausea

7459
07:01:43,558 --> 07:01:46,120
vomiting blood in the loose watery sto

7460
07:01:46,120 --> 07:01:48,760
loses and the examination of stool one

7461
07:01:48,760 --> 07:01:51,638
can detect dentry Shela species now next

7462
07:01:51,638 --> 07:01:52,680
is

7463
07:01:52,680 --> 07:01:56,638
plague Yia Pesce now plague whenever

7464
07:01:56,638 --> 07:01:58,760
plague comes in our mind we say it is

7465
07:01:58,760 --> 07:02:00,240
because of

7466
07:02:00,240 --> 07:02:04,600
rat it is because of yenia pestis they

7467
07:02:04,600 --> 07:02:08,718
spread by the fleas rat

7468
07:02:08,718 --> 07:02:11,080
fleas and where do they live they live

7469
07:02:11,080 --> 07:02:15,240
in our blood and lymph now fever

7470
07:02:15,240 --> 07:02:17,320
headache weakness and this was a reason

7471
07:02:17,320 --> 07:02:19,760
for Black Death just like that of a

7472
07:02:19,760 --> 07:02:22,160
Corona pandemic here that was also also

7473
07:02:22,160 --> 07:02:25,920
a pandemic the black death now bacterium

7474
07:02:25,920 --> 07:02:28,120
fluid from the lymph node and the blood

7475
07:02:28,120 --> 07:02:30,680
of the sputum gives us an idea whether

7476
07:02:30,680 --> 07:02:33,320
person is suffering from this or

7477
07:02:33,320 --> 07:02:38,120
not dpia corny bacterium dpia mucus

7478
07:02:38,120 --> 07:02:40,558
membrane of nose throat tonsils direct

7479
07:02:40,558 --> 07:02:43,240
contact with infected person th throat

7480
07:02:43,240 --> 07:02:46,240
fever enlarged lymph node

7481
07:02:46,240 --> 07:02:51,240
test done next is whooping calf oh Peru

7482
07:02:51,240 --> 07:02:54,840
say pela pertusis respiratory tract it

7483
07:02:54,840 --> 07:02:56,958
affect it spread from one person to

7484
07:02:56,958 --> 07:02:59,160
another if one person is affected then

7485
07:02:59,160 --> 07:03:00,920
another person can also get it if you

7486
07:03:00,920 --> 07:03:03,478
cuff in front of him now next is severe

7487
07:03:03,478 --> 07:03:05,718
cuffing characteristics loud woofing

7488
07:03:05,718 --> 07:03:08,000
cuff nose and the throat test and the

7489
07:03:08,000 --> 07:03:10,760
blood test can gives us the whooping

7490
07:03:10,760 --> 07:03:12,398
cuff

7491
07:03:12,398 --> 07:03:16,440
yeah pusis bellaa pusis moving on to the

7492
07:03:16,440 --> 07:03:18,920
next is

7493
07:03:18,920 --> 07:03:20,878
tuberculosis Micco bacterium

7494
07:03:20,878 --> 07:03:24,080
tuberculosis is lungs it affects the

7495
07:03:24,080 --> 07:03:27,638
lungs pum test even in the X-ray we can

7496
07:03:27,638 --> 07:03:29,120
detect whether the person is suffering

7497
07:03:29,120 --> 07:03:32,958
from you will find some patches there

7498
07:03:32,958 --> 07:03:36,040
right cuff Blood also comes out so if

7499
07:03:36,040 --> 07:03:39,200
you have cuff it is considered here um

7500
07:03:39,200 --> 07:03:41,600

07:03:49,120 --> 07:03:51,840
sputum chest pain loss of weight mon

7504
07:03:51,840 --> 07:03:54,638
test at the blood test syphilis syphilis

7505
07:03:54,638 --> 07:03:58,320
to already we have done right in STDs so

7506
07:03:58,320 --> 07:04:02,558
syphilis tripona padam goria neria gonor

7507
07:04:02,558 --> 07:04:04,958
all these are the bacteria these are the

7508
07:04:04,958 --> 07:04:07,320
sexual contact detail is being given

7509
07:04:07,320 --> 07:04:08,958
this will be important for the another

7510
07:04:08,958 --> 07:04:10,760
chapter

7511
07:04:10,760 --> 07:04:15,680
also okay now let's talk about the viral

7512
07:04:15,680 --> 07:04:17,280
diseases these were the bacterial

7513
07:04:17,280 --> 07:04:18,600
diseases

7514
07:04:18,600 --> 07:04:20,798
tuberculosis there was syphilis there

7515
07:04:20,798 --> 07:04:24,478
was goria there was whooping cuff there

7516
07:04:24,478 --> 07:04:26,200
were a lot of diseases right now let's

7517
07:04:26,200 --> 07:04:27,760
talk about the viral disease the viral

7518
07:04:27,760 --> 07:04:30,600
diseases first comes is the common cold

7519
07:04:30,600 --> 07:04:32,718
so common cold is that disease which we

7520
07:04:32,718 --> 07:04:34,920
all suffer from every now and then and

7521
07:04:34,920 --> 07:04:36,920
you know this is because of the Rhino

7522
07:04:36,920 --> 07:04:39,398
virus how does it spread definitely

7523
07:04:39,398 --> 07:04:40,878
droplet infection if one person is

7524
07:04:40,878 --> 07:04:42,680
suffering other person can also suffer

7525
07:04:42,680 --> 07:04:45,878
by sharing pen Etc by living next to

7526
07:04:45,878 --> 07:04:48,840
them so that this is how it spread we do

7527
07:04:48,840 --> 07:04:50,520
not take any medicine for that because

7528
07:04:50,520 --> 07:04:53,520
after two to two to 3 days maximum 3 to

7529
07:04:53,520 --> 07:04:55,920
4 days it get cured by themselves

7530
07:04:55,920 --> 07:04:59,160
droplet resulting from the Cuffs sneezes

7531
07:04:59,160 --> 07:05:01,440
infected person are either inhaled

7532
07:05:01,440 --> 07:05:03,320
directly transmitted through the

7533
07:05:03,320 --> 07:05:06,320
contaminated object such as pens book

7534
07:05:06,320 --> 07:05:09,280
cup door knob computer table computer

7535
07:05:09,280 --> 07:05:12,040
keyboard mouse Etc it affects the mucous

7536
07:05:12,040 --> 07:05:14,878
membrane of respiratory tract

7537
07:05:14,878 --> 07:05:17,600
so many students they ask me this

7538
07:05:17,600 --> 07:05:18,718
question ma what is the difference

7539
07:05:18,718 --> 07:05:20,638
between a pneumonia and a common cold

7540
07:05:20,638 --> 07:05:22,478
common cold affects the mucous membrane

7541
07:05:22,478 --> 07:05:25,280
here but the pneumonia affects the

7542
07:05:25,280 --> 07:05:27,760
alali clear so there will be swelling

7543
07:05:27,760 --> 07:05:29,760
here due to which person is not able to

7544
07:05:29,760 --> 07:05:31,638
breathe whereas in pneumonia lungs are

7545
07:05:31,638 --> 07:05:35,398
affected now here infect the nose and

7546
07:05:35,398 --> 07:05:37,638
the respiratory passage not the lungs

7547
07:05:37,638 --> 07:05:40,360
nasal congestion discharge sore throat

7548
07:05:40,360 --> 07:05:43,840
Hess headache tiredness usually last for

7549
07:05:43,840 --> 07:05:45,920
3 to 7 Days self

7550
07:05:45,920 --> 07:05:48,600
diagnosable right very common and

7551
07:05:48,600 --> 07:05:50,600
whenever in on our house if someone is

7552
07:05:50,600 --> 07:05:53,160
having common cold we get that very

7553
07:05:53,160 --> 07:05:55,798
common common C very common Rhino

7554
07:05:55,798 --> 07:05:57,718
virus

7555
07:05:57,718 --> 07:06:02,600
okay now small poox this is the one

7556
07:06:02,600 --> 07:06:05,360
which is completely eradicated small

7557
07:06:05,360 --> 07:06:08,240
poox virus it's a virus disease caused

7558
07:06:08,240 --> 07:06:12,080
by the viola virus by contact droplet

7559
07:06:12,080 --> 07:06:15,398
formite skin rashes which forms the

7560
07:06:15,398 --> 07:06:18,240
pusle which causes scab and this is how

7561
07:06:18,240 --> 07:06:20,520
they spread some fluid come out and they

7562
07:06:20,520 --> 07:06:22,440
spread from one person to to another

7563
07:06:22,440 --> 07:06:25,040
blister fluid they take out and the skin

7564
07:06:25,040 --> 07:06:27,718
scrapping they take out by doing the

7565
07:06:27,718 --> 07:06:29,638
Laboratory test whether the small pox

7566
07:06:29,638 --> 07:06:31,840
virus is there or not we can get to know

7567
07:06:31,840 --> 07:06:34,240
it is positive for them or not small pox

7568
07:06:34,240 --> 07:06:37,200
completely eradicated from India next is

7569
07:06:37,200 --> 07:06:41,240
chicken pox very zuster virus do not be

7570
07:06:41,240 --> 07:06:42,878
confused this is a verola virus this is

7571
07:06:42,878 --> 07:06:45,280
a very Sola zuster virus by contact it

7572
07:06:45,280 --> 07:06:48,200
spread skin Source open and the emit

watery eyes and the skin rash blood test

7578
07:07:04,840 --> 07:07:07,558
polio you all know this is the one which

7579
07:07:07,558 --> 07:07:10,398
spread uh which affects the nerve cell

7580
07:07:10,398 --> 07:07:11,920
due to

7581
07:07:11,920 --> 07:07:14,840
which the there there's a inflammation

7582
07:07:14,840 --> 07:07:17,000
of nervous system it causes the

7583
07:07:17,000 --> 07:07:19,440

virus fighting of mosquito here many

7587
07:07:29,958 --> 07:07:32,000
time question comes from this topic what

7588
07:07:32,000 --> 07:07:34,000
is a costive age how does it spread

7589
07:07:34,000 --> 07:07:37,440
spread through Adis egypti Adis

7590
07:07:37,440 --> 07:07:40,600
egypti plasmodium vaa that spread

7591
07:07:40,600 --> 07:07:43,398
through anop but this is Adis egypti

7592
07:07:43,398 --> 07:07:45,718
please remember everyone this is Adis

7593
07:07:45,718 --> 07:07:49,840
egypti okay next is mile conjuctivitis

7594
07:07:49,840 --> 07:07:53,200
high fever backache nausea vomiting with

7595
07:07:53,200 --> 07:07:55,398
the help of Eliza this can be detected

7596
07:07:55,398 --> 07:08:00,000
Dy arbo virus ad it is Egypt Egypt

7597
07:08:00,000 --> 07:08:03,360
please remember everyone clear a is egyp

7598
07:08:03,360 --> 07:08:06,160
many times this has been asked in one

7599
07:08:06,160 --> 07:08:09,280
Mark okay now protozoan disease first we

7600
07:08:09,280 --> 07:08:11,200
have is a malaria malaria we will be

7601
07:08:11,200 --> 07:08:13,360
discussing in detail we have malaria in

7602
07:08:13,360 --> 07:08:16,798
detail let's talk about amasis amasis is

7603
07:08:16,798 --> 07:08:20,120
because of the anba hisoa anba hisoa

7604
07:08:20,120 --> 07:08:23,000
causes problem here in the stomach it

7605
07:08:23,000 --> 07:08:25,160
affects the mucus membrane so person

7606
07:08:25,160 --> 07:08:27,920
feel lot of pain so how does it spread

7607
07:08:27,920 --> 07:08:31,680
by eating the outside food Ana hisoa it

7608
07:08:31,680 --> 07:08:33,840
remain the large intestine so sometime

7609
07:08:33,840 --> 07:08:36,478
it yes our when our food is infested

7610
07:08:36,478 --> 07:08:39,558
with the uh you know the house fly they

7611
07:08:39,558 --> 07:08:42,600
are the carrier of antoa hyola so they

7612
07:08:42,600 --> 07:08:44,718
contaminate our food and water due to

7613
07:08:44,718 --> 07:08:47,080
which we fail constipated abdominal pain

7614
07:08:47,080 --> 07:08:50,558
cramp uh and SP stool with mucus and the

7615
07:08:50,558 --> 07:08:54,200
blood blood and stool

7616
07:08:54,240 --> 07:08:55,760
test

7617
07:08:55,760 --> 07:08:58,958
next ascariasis

7618
07:08:58,958 --> 07:09:03,320
ascaris ascaris swm intestinal parasite

7619
07:09:03,320 --> 07:09:07,120
here eggs of parasite are excreted along

7620
07:09:07,120 --> 07:09:09,958
with the feces infected person which

7621
07:09:09,958 --> 07:09:11,958
contaminate soil water vegetables and

7622
07:09:11,958 --> 07:09:13,360
fruits so

7623
07:09:13,360 --> 07:09:17,000
ascaris is a neod right it's a round

7624
07:09:17,000 --> 07:09:20,760
worm escalus ascaris lumbricoides so

7625
07:09:20,760 --> 07:09:23,040
when one person is suffering from it in

7626
07:09:23,040 --> 07:09:25,398
the body sexual reproduction occur and

7627
07:09:25,398 --> 07:09:27,558
in the intestine they produce eggs the

7628
07:09:27,558 --> 07:09:29,798
egg they go out from the body with the

7629
07:09:29,798 --> 07:09:32,878
help of a feis and when the seage water

7630
07:09:32,878 --> 07:09:35,878
it goes to the you know agriculture land

7631
07:09:35,878 --> 07:09:38,200
it can affect the fruits and a vegetable

7632
07:09:38,200 --> 07:09:40,478
it cause infestation there and once we

7633
07:09:40,478 --> 07:09:42,558
consume our fruits and vegetable without

7634
07:09:42,558 --> 07:09:44,958
proper washing them again we can get the

7635
07:09:44,958 --> 07:09:48,200
escaras infection now internal be

7636
07:09:48,200 --> 07:09:50,440
leading they can cause muscular pain

7637
07:09:50,440 --> 07:09:53,160
fever and IIA blockage of intestinal

7638
07:09:53,160 --> 07:09:58,440
passage stool test fasis ferial warm

7639
07:09:58,440 --> 07:10:01,120
elephantiasis first of agent is weria

7640
07:10:01,120 --> 07:10:05,040
bankrupty weria

7641
07:10:05,840 --> 07:10:09,120
malayi now bite of mosquito clex

7642
07:10:09,120 --> 07:10:12,478
mosquito previously it was Adis Egyptian

7643
07:10:12,478 --> 07:10:15,638
dingi here it is clex mosquito everybody

7644
07:10:15,638 --> 07:10:18,878
will remember this now ferial worms live

7645
07:10:18,878 --> 07:10:21,200
in lymphatic vessels chronic in

7646
07:10:21,200 --> 07:10:23,040
inflammation of the organ in which they

7647
07:10:23,040 --> 07:10:25,558
live for many years lims and genital

7648
07:10:25,558 --> 07:10:27,120
organ may be

7649
07:10:27,120 --> 07:10:32,080
deformed ICT fasis test so here what

7650
07:10:32,080 --> 07:10:35,120
happens is limb the you know scotle sack

7651
07:10:35,120 --> 07:10:37,798
they swallow so they become huge in size

7652
07:10:37,798 --> 07:10:39,360
that is the reason we call this disease

7653
07:10:39,360 --> 07:10:42,718
as U elephantiasis elephant type

7654
07:10:42,718 --> 07:10:45,440
diseases because the lymphs they become

7655
07:10:45,440 --> 07:10:49,080
huge in size and uh they actually block

7656
07:10:49,080 --> 07:10:50,798
the lymph vessel so that is the reason

7657
07:10:50,798 --> 07:10:52,320
it

7658
07:10:52,320 --> 07:10:55,320
happens

7659
07:10:55,320 --> 07:10:58,760
okay now the last one fungal disease

7660
07:10:58,760 --> 07:11:02,280
ring worm dadad KU what is this ring

7661
07:11:02,280 --> 07:11:05,160
worm the Ring Worm it causes some

7662
07:11:05,160 --> 07:11:07,638
abration like thing here and this is

7663
07:11:07,638 --> 07:11:10,080
because of the fungus ring it says Ring

7664
07:11:10,080 --> 07:11:12,280
Worm but it is not because of the worm

7665
07:11:12,280 --> 07:11:14,600
it looks like some scab is there some

7666
07:11:14,600 --> 07:11:17,200
reddish scab that cause eing fluid comes

7667
07:11:17,200 --> 07:11:19,360
out so that is because of the three

7668
07:11:19,360 --> 07:11:22,280
different species of a fungus

7669
07:11:22,280 --> 07:11:25,718
microsporum tropen

7670
07:11:25,718 --> 07:11:28,760
epidermophyton microsporum troyen

7671
07:11:28,760 --> 07:11:31,280
epidermophyton three all three you have

7672
07:11:31,280 --> 07:11:34,200
to remember given in ncrt so how does it

7673
07:11:34,200 --> 07:11:36,320
spread because if one person is affected

7674
07:11:36,320 --> 07:11:37,920
if you use their towel if you'll use

7675
07:11:37,920 --> 07:11:40,280
their brushes so yes it can spread from

7676
07:11:40,280 --> 07:11:42,280
one person to

7677
07:11:42,280 --> 07:11:45,718
another now from soil or by using the

7678
07:11:45,718 --> 07:11:48,958
towel clothes com heat moisture help

7679
07:11:48,958 --> 07:11:51,520
fungi to grow more which means make them

7680
07:11:51,520 --> 07:11:54,680
thrive in the skin folds such as those

7681
07:11:54,680 --> 07:11:56,360
area in the groin and in between the

7682
07:11:56,360 --> 07:11:58,558
toes so because of those areas in

7683
07:11:58,558 --> 07:12:00,280
between the toe toes there are moisture

7684
07:12:00,280 --> 07:12:03,440
so they develop more at those areas now

7685
07:12:03,440 --> 07:12:06,320
symptoms appearance of dry scaly leion

7686
07:12:06,320 --> 07:12:08,558
on the various body parts such as Skin

7687
07:12:08,558 --> 07:12:11,160
nail scalp lesions are accompanied by

7688
07:12:11,160 --> 07:12:13,000
the intense eating by looking at the

7689
07:12:13,000 --> 07:12:15,440
skin and with the use of antifungal

7690
07:12:15,440 --> 07:12:17,280
powders we can

7691
07:12:17,280 --> 07:12:20,878
easily get rid of the such problem okay

7692
07:12:20,878 --> 07:12:22,920
now now let's talk about as I've

7693
07:12:22,920 --> 07:12:24,520
discussed with you we have to discuss

7694
07:12:24,520 --> 07:12:27,520
the malaria in detail so let's start the

7695
07:12:27,520 --> 07:12:30,360
malaria let's start reading about the

7696
07:12:30,360 --> 07:12:33,600
malaria let's not start the

7697
07:12:33,798 --> 07:12:37,920
malaria yes all three name you have to

7698
07:12:37,920 --> 07:12:39,638
learn now

7699
07:12:39,638 --> 07:12:43,680
malaria malaria is caused by you know

7700
07:12:43,680 --> 07:12:46,000
given over here plasmodium so there are

7701
07:12:46,000 --> 07:12:48,600
various species of plasmodium one is

7702
07:12:48,600 --> 07:12:52,280
plasmodium VX malaria

7703
07:12:52,280 --> 07:12:55,398
felip perum and plasmodium

7704
07:12:55,398 --> 07:12:58,440
ovil these are the different species

7705
07:12:58,440 --> 07:13:00,600
right they causes different type of

7706
07:13:00,600 --> 07:13:03,398
malaria turchan malaria different

7707
07:13:03,398 --> 07:13:06,240
malarias are there so they cause cause

7708
07:13:06,240 --> 07:13:10,520
that now life cycle plasmodium require

7709
07:13:10,520 --> 07:13:13,200
two holes to complete the life cycle one

7710
07:13:13,200 --> 07:13:16,958
is termed as humans and second is

7711
07:13:16,958 --> 07:13:20,398
musk in the human they reproduce by the

7712
07:13:20,398 --> 07:13:23,160
asexual ual

7713
07:13:23,160 --> 07:13:26,478
method and in the mosquito they develop

7714
07:13:26,478 --> 07:13:29,000
by the sexual

7715
07:13:29,000 --> 07:13:32,520
reproduction sexual and

7716
07:13:32,520 --> 07:13:36,920
asexual clear so primary host for the

7717
07:13:36,920 --> 07:13:41,360
anop is the what primary host is what

7718
07:13:41,360 --> 07:13:43,440
primary host is a mosquito secondary

7719
07:13:43,440 --> 07:13:46,240
host is the human where they reproduce

7720
07:13:46,240 --> 07:13:49,120
by the asexual method so let's have a

7721
07:13:49,120 --> 07:13:51,718
look life cycle

7722
07:13:51,718 --> 07:13:54,638
very easy peasy can be asked again in a

7723
07:13:54,638 --> 07:13:56,000
three marker

7724
07:13:56,000 --> 07:13:59,080
guys infected person Andes musquito

7725
07:13:59,080 --> 07:14:02,280
bites the human whenever infected

7726
07:14:02,280 --> 07:14:04,600
mosquito they bite the human the

7727
07:14:04,600 --> 07:14:09,280
infected mosquito Andes will carry the

7728
07:14:09,280 --> 07:14:13,000
sporo it will carry the sporo and sporo

7729
07:14:13,000 --> 07:14:16,558
zoids will enter into the human right

7730
07:14:16,558 --> 07:14:19,360
plasmodium enter the human infectious

7731
07:14:19,360 --> 07:14:22,360
form sporozoite and reached via blood

7732
07:14:22,360 --> 07:14:24,478
now this is going to circulate all these

7733
07:14:24,478 --> 07:14:26,638
sporo oid will circulate in blood for

7734
07:14:26,638 --> 07:14:29,240
half an hour 1 second they will

7735
07:14:29,240 --> 07:14:31,718
circulate in blood for half an hour and

7736
07:14:31,718 --> 07:14:33,558
after that half an hour it can migrate

7737
07:14:33,558 --> 07:14:35,638
to other structures specifically the

7738
07:14:35,638 --> 07:14:38,040
liver then they go to the liver and they

7739
07:14:38,040 --> 07:14:41,360
multiply asexually in the liver cell in

7740
07:14:41,360 --> 07:14:45,040
the liver they cause exoerythrocytic

7741
07:14:45,040 --> 07:14:48,558
shogi not given again then they go to

7742
07:14:48,558 --> 07:14:51,000
the blood again they attack the red

7743
07:14:51,000 --> 07:14:53,520
blood cell when they attack the red

7744
07:14:53,520 --> 07:14:55,718
blood cell they feed on the RBC

7745
07:14:55,718 --> 07:14:58,200
hemoglobin they release some toxins

7746
07:14:58,200 --> 07:14:59,600
which are termed as

7747
07:14:59,600 --> 07:15:02,878
hemoo and these hemoo is the one which

7748
07:15:02,878 --> 07:15:06,680
is responsible for fever so hemoo is a

7749
07:15:06,680 --> 07:15:10,240
toxic substance which causes the

7750
07:15:10,240 --> 07:15:14,160
fever which causes the fever decrease

7751
07:15:14,160 --> 07:15:17,600
result in due to which chill high fever

7752
07:15:17,600 --> 07:15:20,080
reoccurring every 3 to 4 days so

7753
07:15:20,080 --> 07:15:21,718
characteristic features is after 24

7754
07:15:21,718 --> 07:15:23,520
hours you will get the fever after 36

7755
07:15:23,520 --> 07:15:25,040
hours you will get the fever depending

7756
07:15:25,040 --> 07:15:27,920
on which disease you are which type of

7757
07:15:27,920 --> 07:15:30,000
malaria you are suffering

7758
07:15:30,000 --> 07:15:31,520
from

7759
07:15:31,520 --> 07:15:34,638
now life cycle in the mosquito now what

7760
07:15:34,638 --> 07:15:36,280
happens

7761
07:15:36,280 --> 07:15:39,680
is sexual stages see what happens is

7762
07:15:39,680 --> 07:15:42,478
when this sporo Zoid first it migrate to

7763
07:15:42,478 --> 07:15:45,120
the blood then from the blood it goes to

7764
07:15:45,120 --> 07:15:47,160
the liver liver may it will undergo the

7765
07:15:47,160 --> 07:15:49,478
chisoon asexual reproduction they will

7766
07:15:49,478 --> 07:15:50,958
affect the liver cell then then they

7767
07:15:50,958 --> 07:15:53,080
will migrate to the blood in the blood

7768
07:15:53,080 --> 07:15:55,000
they show different stages Signet ring

7769
07:15:55,000 --> 07:15:57,520
stage amii boid stage and in between

7770
07:15:57,520 --> 07:15:59,320
that they release hemozoin also and

7771
07:15:59,320 --> 07:16:02,600
because of hemoo we get fever and chills

7772
07:16:02,600 --> 07:16:05,080
clear hope this point is clear till now

7773
07:16:05,080 --> 07:16:07,280
now moving on to the next if I talk

7774
07:16:07,280 --> 07:16:09,680
about now what happens in the blood so

7775
07:16:09,680 --> 07:16:13,160
in the blood they will form gy female

7776
07:16:13,160 --> 07:16:15,718
Gite and male Gite female Gite will be

7777
07:16:15,718 --> 07:16:18,920
bigger and the female male Gite will be

7778
07:16:18,920 --> 07:16:22,718
smaller now section ual stage gamy

7779
07:16:22,718 --> 07:16:25,000
develop in human RBC now what will

7780
07:16:25,000 --> 07:16:28,200
happen another female anop who was not

7781
07:16:28,200 --> 07:16:31,080
having any kind of sporozoite any

7782
07:16:31,080 --> 07:16:33,600
disease now they will come and they will

7783
07:16:33,600 --> 07:16:36,320
pick up the Gite they will feed on blood

7784
07:16:36,320 --> 07:16:37,760
and along with the blood they will get a

7785
07:16:37,760 --> 07:16:39,160
treat

7786
07:16:39,160 --> 07:16:41,478
gyes and now what will happen the

7787
07:16:41,478 --> 07:16:44,120
parasite will enter the mosquito body

7788
07:16:44,120 --> 07:16:47,160
parasite will enter the mosquito body

7789
07:16:47,160 --> 07:16:50,280
done now what will happen as parasite

7790
07:16:50,280 --> 07:16:53,240
enter the mosquito body gamy will be

7791
07:16:53,240 --> 07:16:56,120
converted into

7792
07:16:56,440 --> 07:16:58,160
gamuts

7793
07:16:58,160 --> 07:17:03,240
Gite will be converted into the

7794
07:17:03,798 --> 07:17:06,558
gametes gyes will be converted into the

7795
07:17:06,558 --> 07:17:09,160
gamits male gametocytes will form male

7796
07:17:09,160 --> 07:17:11,478
gamut female gamy will form the female

7797
07:17:11,478 --> 07:17:16,040
gamut clear now fertilization occur now

7798
07:17:16,040 --> 07:17:17,320
there will be development in the

7799
07:17:17,320 --> 07:17:19,878
mosquito so those gamut female gamut and

7800
07:17:19,878 --> 07:17:21,798
male gamut they will fertiliz together

7801
07:17:21,798 --> 07:17:23,958
what we will get is a zygote and then

7802
07:17:23,958 --> 07:17:25,558
they develop and what they form is a

7803
07:17:25,558 --> 07:17:28,040
sporo zoids now multiply to form

7804
07:17:28,040 --> 07:17:30,080
sporozoite which is an infective stage

7805
07:17:30,080 --> 07:17:32,280
which goes to the salivary gland it

7806
07:17:32,280 --> 07:17:35,558
remain there now anop which was not

7807
07:17:35,558 --> 07:17:38,320
having any problem now she is having

7808
07:17:38,320 --> 07:17:41,398
sporozoite that two in the salivary

7809
07:17:41,398 --> 07:17:44,000
glands that two in the salivary glands

7810
07:17:44,000 --> 07:17:45,920
and if it is

7811
07:17:45,920 --> 07:17:48,840
there

7812
07:17:48,840 --> 07:17:52,520
so done

7813
07:17:53,040 --> 07:17:55,760
okay so so with this we have completed

7814
07:17:55,760 --> 07:17:57,440
the disease part now we are moving to

7815
07:17:57,440 --> 07:18:00,600
the next part that is the

7816
07:18:00,600 --> 07:18:05,958
immunity okay okay now immunity what is

7817
07:18:05,958 --> 07:18:09,878
immunity immunity is the ability of a

7818
07:18:09,878 --> 07:18:12,920
hor to fight with the disease causing

7819
07:18:12,920 --> 07:18:15,600
organism I have a capacity I have that

7820
07:18:15,600 --> 07:18:17,280
immunity that I can fight against this

7821
07:18:17,280 --> 07:18:19,520
disease that disease that pathogen Etc

7822
07:18:19,520 --> 07:18:21,798
that will be my immunity

7823
07:18:21,798 --> 07:18:24,760
conferred by the immune system we have a

7824
07:18:24,760 --> 07:18:26,520
proper immune system in our body just

7825
07:18:26,520 --> 07:18:28,360
like that D system we have respiratory

7826
07:18:28,360 --> 07:18:30,280
system we have a proper immune system

7827
07:18:30,280 --> 07:18:32,000
where lot of cells are there lot of

7828
07:18:32,000 --> 07:18:34,600
structures are there which are important

7829
07:18:34,600 --> 07:18:36,398
for fighting against the different

7830
07:18:36,398 --> 07:18:39,160
pathogen present in the

7831
07:18:39,160 --> 07:18:42,000
environment okay okay let's

7832
07:18:42,000 --> 07:18:44,920
proceed now with this chart now we will

7833
07:18:44,920 --> 07:18:47,600
learn each and every line everyone

7834
07:18:47,600 --> 07:18:49,160
please Focus over

7835
07:18:49,160 --> 07:18:52,280
here uh

7836
07:18:52,280 --> 07:18:55,840
okay immunity immunity is what it is the

7837
07:18:55,840 --> 07:18:58,200
ability of a host to fight the disease

7838
07:18:58,200 --> 07:19:01,718
causing organism this is immunity now

7839
07:19:01,718 --> 07:19:04,040
immunity is of two type when this

7840
07:19:04,040 --> 07:19:07,558
immunity is present from

7841
07:19:07,558 --> 07:19:11,040
birth this is termed as the non-specific

7842
07:19:11,040 --> 07:19:12,360
innate

7843
07:19:12,360 --> 07:19:14,920
immunity it consists of four typ when a

7844
07:19:14,920 --> 07:19:17,558
child is born child will be having skin

7845
07:19:17,558 --> 07:19:19,638
and mucosa which will not allow the

7846
07:19:19,638 --> 07:19:21,320
pathogen to enter into the body that

7847
07:19:21,320 --> 07:19:23,718
comes under the physical barrier of a

7848
07:19:23,718 --> 07:19:27,040
baby child will be secreting saliva tear

7849
07:19:27,040 --> 07:19:28,878
gastric juices that will come under the

7850
07:19:28,878 --> 07:19:30,958
physiological barrier that will not

7851
07:19:30,958 --> 07:19:33,878
allow the pathogen to enter next thing

7852
07:19:33,878 --> 07:19:36,478
is they will be having some cells like

7853
07:19:36,478 --> 07:19:39,440
pmnl neutrophils are there

7854
07:19:39,440 --> 07:19:42,920
polymorphonuclear lucites then monoy NK

7855
07:19:42,920 --> 07:19:44,840
cells macras are there which are

7856
07:19:44,840 --> 07:19:46,360
normally present and they cause

7857
07:19:46,360 --> 07:19:48,240
non-specific immunity they're not

7858
07:19:48,240 --> 07:19:50,600
specific but whatever for foreign things

7859
07:19:50,600 --> 07:19:52,680
will come they will kill them it's not

7860
07:19:52,680 --> 07:19:54,520
specific but they will definitely kill

7861
07:19:54,520 --> 07:19:58,600
them now cyto keines cyto keines may we

7862
07:19:58,600 --> 07:20:02,040
have an example of interfer

7863
07:20:02,040 --> 07:20:04,798
interferons okay we have is a

7864
07:20:04,798 --> 07:20:06,440
interferons

7865
07:20:06,440 --> 07:20:11,160
so acquired immunity specific acquired

7866
07:20:11,160 --> 07:20:12,760
immunity is that immunity which we

7867
07:20:12,760 --> 07:20:15,958
develop with our

7868
07:20:16,160 --> 07:20:19,160
lifetime

7869
07:20:19,320 --> 07:20:21,798
develop

7870
07:20:21,798 --> 07:20:25,558
with exposure

7871
07:20:27,160 --> 07:20:30,160
to

7872
07:20:32,200 --> 07:20:33,958
pathogen

7873
07:20:33,958 --> 07:20:37,760
in our

7874
07:20:37,760 --> 07:20:41,000
lives right now acquired immunity is the

7875
07:20:41,000 --> 07:20:43,398
immunity which is specific which is not

7876
07:20:43,398 --> 07:20:46,280
casual it is specific it is specific

7877
07:20:46,280 --> 07:20:49,240
characterized by memory it shows a

7878
07:20:49,240 --> 07:20:51,760
diversity

7879
07:20:51,760 --> 07:20:55,120
our body produce lots of antibodies and

7880
07:20:55,120 --> 07:20:58,120
it shows a discrimination between self

7881
07:20:58,120 --> 07:21:00,760
and nonself these are the four points

7882
07:21:00,760 --> 07:21:03,200
you have to

7883
07:21:04,240 --> 07:21:07,240
remember

7884
07:21:11,398 --> 07:21:15,558
between self and La self specificity

7885
07:21:15,558 --> 07:21:19,160
diversity the characterized by memory

7886
07:21:19,160 --> 07:21:21,398
discrimination between the self and

7887
07:21:21,398 --> 07:21:23,120
nonself these are the four features

7888
07:21:23,120 --> 07:21:25,040
which are present in

7889
07:21:25,040 --> 07:21:27,920
this acquired immunity is of two type

7890
07:21:27,920 --> 07:21:30,160
active immunity and passive immunity now

7891
07:21:30,160 --> 07:21:31,398
what are these active and passive

7892
07:21:31,398 --> 07:21:33,360
immunity active immunity is that

7893
07:21:33,360 --> 07:21:37,360
immunity where our body is producing

7894
07:21:37,360 --> 07:21:41,600
antibodies so here what do I mean by

7895
07:21:41,600 --> 07:21:43,440
this

7896
07:21:43,440 --> 07:21:46,440
body

7897
07:21:48,360 --> 07:21:51,878
producing anti

7898
07:21:51,878 --> 07:21:54,520
bodies if some pathogen is coming and

7899
07:21:54,520 --> 07:21:56,600
body is producing antibodies that comes

7900
07:21:56,600 --> 07:21:59,120
under the active immunity passive

7901
07:21:59,120 --> 07:22:01,398
immunities that means antibodies we are

7902
07:22:01,398 --> 07:22:04,040
taking from

7903
07:22:10,160 --> 07:22:13,200
outside from

7904
07:22:13,200 --> 07:22:16,520
outside clear now active immunity active

7905
07:22:16,520 --> 07:22:18,840
immunity is further of two type natural

7906
07:22:18,840 --> 07:22:20,920
active immunity and artificial active

7907
07:22:20,920 --> 07:22:24,080
immunity natural now here suppose

7908
07:22:24,080 --> 07:22:26,638
pathogen comes you went outside you had

7909
07:22:26,638 --> 07:22:30,000
golapa right it was open it was not

7910
07:22:30,000 --> 07:22:32,718
hygienically prepared so pathogen will

7911
07:22:32,718 --> 07:22:34,878
enter in your body your body will start

7912
07:22:34,878 --> 07:22:36,958
forming the

7913
07:22:36,958 --> 07:22:40,878
antibodies natural active

7914
07:22:40,878 --> 07:22:44,360
immunity now the next one is artificial

7915
07:22:44,360 --> 07:22:48,000
active immunity you took vaccine

7916
07:22:48,000 --> 07:22:50,958
shot Corona vaccine Co vaccine which one

7917
07:22:50,958 --> 07:22:54,040
did you took so you did you take any

7918
07:22:54,040 --> 07:22:56,080
vaccine right so I'm talking about those

7919
07:22:56,080 --> 07:22:58,600
vaccines so vaccines are what vaccines

7920
07:22:58,600 --> 07:23:02,520
are attenuated healed K killed pathogens

7921
07:23:02,520 --> 07:23:05,440
so we are taking vaccines vaccines means

7922
07:23:05,440 --> 07:23:09,200
pathogen healed killed disarmed pathogen

7923
07:23:09,200 --> 07:23:11,160
we are taking from outside and then our

7924
07:23:11,160 --> 07:23:13,718
body is producing antibodies against uh

7925
07:23:13,718 --> 07:23:16,478
that and creating um you know memories

7926
07:23:16,478 --> 07:23:19,080
for that that comes under this

7927
07:23:19,080 --> 07:23:20,798
category

7928
07:23:20,798 --> 07:23:23,558
now next one is passive immunity is

7929
07:23:23,558 --> 07:23:25,798
further of two type natural passive

7930
07:23:25,798 --> 07:23:29,000
immunity mother feeds the baby and when

7931
07:23:29,000 --> 07:23:32,398
mother feeds the baby mother passes the

7932
07:23:32,398 --> 07:23:35,440
IG IGA is the one which is present in

7933
07:23:35,440 --> 07:23:37,638
the

7934
07:23:38,920 --> 07:23:42,200
chrum mother's milk if I talk about the

7935
07:23:42,200 --> 07:23:46,958
IG G is the one which can cross the

7936
07:23:49,000 --> 07:23:50,718
placenta

7937
07:23:50,718 --> 07:23:53,398
artificial

7938
07:23:53,398 --> 07:23:56,318
immunity taking PATH taking antibodies

7939
07:23:56,318 --> 07:23:58,200
directly from outside

7940
07:23:58,200 --> 07:24:00,840
artificial passive immunity pre-formed

7941
07:24:00,840 --> 07:24:05,718
antibodies we take right for example ATS

7942
07:24:05,718 --> 07:24:09,558
antias C or snake

7943
07:24:09,558 --> 07:24:12,920
venom right at the time of whenever we

7944
07:24:12,920 --> 07:24:16,200
are bitten by a snake so in that case

7945
07:24:16,200 --> 07:24:18,958
direct these are

7946
07:24:18,958 --> 07:24:20,558
available

7947
07:24:20,558 --> 07:24:24,120
now based on the type of lymphocytes are

7948
07:24:24,120 --> 07:24:27,600
involved there are two type of

7949
07:24:27,878 --> 07:24:30,080
immunity

7950
07:24:30,080 --> 07:24:34,120
one cell mediated

7951
07:24:37,958 --> 07:24:42,040
immunity cell mediated

7952
07:24:45,958 --> 07:24:51,878
immunity and the second one is humoral

7953
07:24:57,080 --> 07:24:59,440
immunity cell mediated immunity and

7954
07:24:59,440 --> 07:25:02,160
humoral immunity now cell mediated

7955
07:25:02,160 --> 07:25:05,040
immunity is that immunity where the T

7956
07:25:05,040 --> 07:25:07,840
lymphocytes are

7957
07:25:11,000 --> 07:25:15,958
involved the lymphocytes are

7958
07:25:18,878 --> 07:25:20,840
involved

7959
07:25:20,840 --> 07:25:23,398
right cell mediated these are those

7960
07:25:23,398 --> 07:25:26,680
immunity where whenever see here what

7961
07:25:26,680 --> 07:25:29,280
happens is T lymy they further

7962
07:25:29,280 --> 07:25:32,760
proliferate when Whenever there is a

7963
07:25:32,760 --> 07:25:35,840
pathogen they proliferate how do they

7964
07:25:35,840 --> 07:25:38,398
proliferate they proliferate into T

7965
07:25:38,398 --> 07:25:42,638
helper cell t cytotoxic or t killer

7966
07:25:42,638 --> 07:25:46,958
cell and T suppressor

7967
07:25:46,958 --> 07:25:50,000
cell helper will help so what is this

7968
07:25:50,000 --> 07:25:52,318
this is a

7969
07:25:52,760 --> 07:25:57,080
helper right this is a

7970
07:25:57,360 --> 07:26:03,040
cytotoxic or killer killer kill oh my

7971
07:26:03,040 --> 07:26:06,840
God this will be

7972
07:26:09,798 --> 07:26:12,200
suppressor they will differentiate and

7973
07:26:12,200 --> 07:26:14,798
they will kill the pathogen they will

7974
07:26:14,798 --> 07:26:18,200
kill the pathogen So This Is How They

7975
07:26:18,200 --> 07:26:20,478
divide one very important thing is when

7976
07:26:20,478 --> 07:26:23,958
we do any grafting suppose uh liver

7977
07:26:23,958 --> 07:26:26,200
transplantation kidney transplantation

7978
07:26:26,200 --> 07:26:28,520
sometime the tissue they are not able to

7979
07:26:28,520 --> 07:26:31,280
graft properly our body you know start

7980
07:26:31,280 --> 07:26:33,638
producing antibodies against it in that

7981
07:26:33,638 --> 07:26:35,840
case which antibodies involved the cell

7982
07:26:35,840 --> 07:26:40,638
mediated immunity involved in graft

7983
07:26:45,478 --> 07:26:48,718
rejection graft

7984
07:26:48,718 --> 07:26:51,718
rejection

7985
07:26:52,160 --> 07:26:54,120
clear moving on to the next is humoral

7986
07:26:54,120 --> 07:26:56,360
immunity humoral immunity they are also

7987
07:26:56,360 --> 07:26:58,638
termed

7988
07:26:58,638 --> 07:27:02,878
as antibody mediated

7989
07:27:07,160 --> 07:27:11,160
immunity mediated

7990
07:27:11,160 --> 07:27:14,080
immunity now in this antibody mediated

7991
07:27:14,080 --> 07:27:16,760
immunity humoral immunity and antibody

7992
07:27:16,760 --> 07:27:19,520
mediated immunity in this immunity what

7993
07:27:19,520 --> 07:27:21,520
we we have is B

7994
07:27:21,520 --> 07:27:25,200
lymphocytes whenever this

7995
07:27:25,200 --> 07:27:28,558
osy whenever this you know and Immunity

7996
07:27:28,558 --> 07:27:33,680
arise in that body what happens is B

7997
07:27:35,920 --> 07:27:39,840
lymphocytes plasma B cells plasma B

7998
07:27:39,840 --> 07:27:42,760
cells produces

7999
07:27:43,878 --> 07:27:46,840
antibodies right and the next one they

8000
07:27:46,840 --> 07:27:50,520
produce is the memory cell

8001
07:27:50,520 --> 07:27:52,360
if you'll come for the next time I will

8002
07:27:52,360 --> 07:27:54,040
kill you in a short duration of time

8003
07:27:54,040 --> 07:27:56,440
this is the

8004
07:27:58,040 --> 07:28:01,558
difference clear memory and the plasma B

8005
07:28:01,558 --> 07:28:05,240
cells okay now as I have discussed with

8006
07:28:05,240 --> 07:28:07,360
you antibodies are there so this is how

8007
07:28:07,360 --> 07:28:09,318
antibody look like again I'm saying you

8008
07:28:09,318 --> 07:28:12,520
cbsc aspirant get ready this question

8009
07:28:12,520 --> 07:28:14,680
can be asked draw the structure of an

8010
07:28:14,680 --> 07:28:18,200
antibody very very very

8011
07:28:18,600 --> 07:28:20,920
important

8012
07:28:20,920 --> 07:28:22,718
this is how a antibody a typical

8013
07:28:22,718 --> 07:28:24,398
antibody look like typical all

8014
07:28:24,398 --> 07:28:26,318
antibodies they do not look

8015
07:28:26,318 --> 07:28:29,360
same here you will see chains are there

8016
07:28:29,360 --> 07:28:31,878
can you see this this one two heavy

8017
07:28:31,878 --> 07:28:33,600
chains are there so it is having a

8018
07:28:33,600 --> 07:28:36,760
structure of H2 two light chains are

8019
07:28:36,760 --> 07:28:40,120
there light chain light chains are there

8020
07:28:40,120 --> 07:28:42,240
right because of Association of heavy

8021
07:28:42,240 --> 07:28:43,920
chains and the light chain they form

8022
07:28:43,920 --> 07:28:46,240
antigen binding site which comes and

8023
07:28:46,240 --> 07:28:48,920
which binds to the antigen they're

8024
07:28:48,920 --> 07:28:51,120
attached to each other by some bonds

8025
07:28:51,120 --> 07:28:52,558
which you can see they are termed as

8026
07:28:52,558 --> 07:28:55,558
disulfide Bond so you should know the

8027
07:28:55,558 --> 07:28:59,040
exact location of these dulfi

8028
07:28:59,040 --> 07:29:03,798
Bond clear everybody clear now antigen

8029
07:29:03,798 --> 07:29:05,958
they come and they will bind over here

8030
07:29:05,958 --> 07:29:09,840
and this one they react to them how do

8031
07:29:09,840 --> 07:29:12,080
they react to them they cause

8032
07:29:12,080 --> 07:29:14,558
opsonization they Cause neutralization

8033
07:29:14,558 --> 07:29:17,080
they basically attach to them that's a

8034
07:29:17,080 --> 07:29:20,398
you know very uh difficult part they go

8035
07:29:20,398 --> 07:29:23,360
and they attach to them so how does they

8036
07:29:23,360 --> 07:29:27,000
attach so let's have a

8037
07:29:27,160 --> 07:29:28,958
look

8038
07:29:28,958 --> 07:29:31,958
so

8039
07:29:33,000 --> 07:29:36,478
antibodies antibody

8040
07:29:36,478 --> 07:29:40,718
functions in this way First Step they

8041
07:29:40,718 --> 07:29:43,200
cause

8042
07:29:43,878 --> 07:29:45,478
agglutination

8043
07:29:45,478 --> 07:29:48,120
tination that means they will go and

8044
07:29:48,120 --> 07:29:51,200
they will bind to the

8045
07:29:51,200 --> 07:29:54,398
antigens second is

8046
07:29:54,398 --> 07:29:56,920
opsonization they will cover

8047
07:29:56,920 --> 07:30:01,280
it and they will start engulfing It

8048
07:30:01,280 --> 07:30:04,878
Whatever toxin they

8049
07:30:04,920 --> 07:30:07,760
produce neutralization they will

8050
07:30:07,760 --> 07:30:10,000
neutralize it these are the different

8051
07:30:10,000 --> 07:30:12,440
steps by which these work these

8052
07:30:12,440 --> 07:30:15,478
antibodies they work clear is this point

8053
07:30:15,478 --> 07:30:17,958
clear so they work in this way they

8054
07:30:17,958 --> 07:30:20,600
agglutinate it they go and they bind to

8055
07:30:20,600 --> 07:30:22,000
the antigen whenever they see any

8056
07:30:22,000 --> 07:30:23,878
foreign body pathogen in our body they

8057
07:30:23,878 --> 07:30:26,240
go and they will bind to it second thing

8058
07:30:26,240 --> 07:30:28,120
is they will cause opsonization they

8059
07:30:28,120 --> 07:30:30,360
will just cover it and they will engulf

8060
07:30:30,360 --> 07:30:32,240
it they will call the macras to come and

8061
07:30:32,240 --> 07:30:35,160
engulf it next is neutralize whatever

8062
07:30:35,160 --> 07:30:37,240
toxin that antigen has produced they're

8063
07:30:37,240 --> 07:30:40,360
going to neutralize those toxins

8064
07:30:40,360 --> 07:30:43,200
also okay

8065
07:30:43,200 --> 07:30:45,958
now these are the antibodies function

8066
07:30:45,958 --> 07:30:48,000
how many types of antibodies are there

8067
07:30:48,000 --> 07:30:51,360
let's have a look

8068
07:30:55,520 --> 07:30:57,558
types

8069
07:30:57,558 --> 07:31:00,558
of

8070
07:31:02,478 --> 07:31:05,718
antibodies there are following type

8071
07:31:05,718 --> 07:31:10,878
they're also termed as imog globulins so

8072
07:31:10,878 --> 07:31:13,760
G IG

8073
07:31:13,760 --> 07:31:16,718
a

8074
07:31:16,718 --> 07:31:20,718
IGM IG d

8075
07:31:20,718 --> 07:31:22,080
i g

8076
07:31:22,080 --> 07:31:24,200
e

8077
07:31:24,200 --> 07:31:29,120
g right clear now

8078
07:31:29,120 --> 07:31:32,760
first G this is the one which can cross

8079
07:31:32,760 --> 07:31:34,878
the

8080
07:31:34,878 --> 07:31:37,680
placenta this is the one which can cross

8081
07:31:37,680 --> 07:31:39,440
the

8082
07:31:39,440 --> 07:31:45,920
placenta right a is the one a present in

8083
07:31:48,280 --> 07:31:51,280
chrom

8084
07:31:54,520 --> 07:31:59,520
present in mother's milk m m means mu mu

8085
07:31:59,520 --> 07:32:02,840
M1 this is the first first which reach

8086
07:32:02,840 --> 07:32:05,920
to the site of

8087
07:32:14,558 --> 07:32:17,718
infection so it is like my

8088
07:32:17,718 --> 07:32:20,638
buddies whenever any pathogen comes in

8089
07:32:20,638 --> 07:32:23,200
our body the first immunoglobin who uh

8090
07:32:23,200 --> 07:32:24,920
you know the number increases in blood

8091
07:32:24,920 --> 07:32:26,280
that is

8092
07:32:26,280 --> 07:32:32,798
IGM IG d d IG D IG D is a one which

8093
07:32:32,798 --> 07:32:35,760
activate B

8094
07:32:37,318 --> 07:32:41,878
cell b cells or B

8095
07:32:47,120 --> 07:32:50,558
lymphocytic bodies clear to all my

8096
07:32:50,558 --> 07:32:53,638
students yes come

8097
07:32:53,638 --> 07:32:56,000
on come on come on come

8098
07:32:56,000 --> 07:33:00,558
on okay now what we are left with now

8099
07:33:00,558 --> 07:33:02,080
let's talk about the

8100
07:33:02,080 --> 07:33:05,478
allergies allergies are exaggerated

8101
07:33:05,478 --> 07:33:07,558
response to of a immune system to

8102
07:33:07,558 --> 07:33:09,000
certain antigen present in the

8103
07:33:09,000 --> 07:33:11,200
environment there are lots of allergens

8104
07:33:11,200 --> 07:33:13,080
present in an environment which are not

8105
07:33:13,080 --> 07:33:15,160
pathogenic to us for example pollin they

8106
07:33:15,160 --> 07:33:17,120
will not cause any harm but our body

8107
07:33:17,120 --> 07:33:19,760
they start producing antibodies against

8108
07:33:19,760 --> 07:33:21,718
so that is the

8109
07:33:21,718 --> 07:33:24,398
allergy substance to which allergy is

8110
07:33:24,398 --> 07:33:26,520
produced are termed as allergen so

8111
07:33:26,520 --> 07:33:28,398
allergen can be anything they can be any

8112
07:33:28,398 --> 07:33:30,080
food some people are allergic to

8113
07:33:30,080 --> 07:33:32,200
mushrooms some people are allergic to

8114
07:33:32,200 --> 07:33:34,878
almond some are allergic to uh you know

8115
07:33:34,878 --> 07:33:39,000
the lemon so they can be any

8116
07:33:43,878 --> 07:33:46,878
Allergan

8117
07:33:46,878 --> 07:33:49,920
clear the antibodies prod used to these

8118
07:33:49,920 --> 07:33:52,878
are IG type as I've told you how will

8119
07:33:52,878 --> 07:33:56,878
you remember IG e e means

8120
07:33:56,878 --> 07:34:00,680
allergy but it's a sorry Anushka Anushka

8121
07:34:00,680 --> 07:34:02,440
it's an English Channel so I cannot talk

8122
07:34:02,440 --> 07:34:05,638
in Hindi

8123
07:34:06,398 --> 07:34:09,120
okay okay it's an English Channel so I

8124
07:34:09,120 --> 07:34:11,040
cannot talk in how can I talk in IND you

8125
07:34:11,040 --> 07:34:12,240
you know the what's the name of this

8126
07:34:12,240 --> 07:34:14,718
channel PW English physics whilea

8127
07:34:14,718 --> 07:34:19,160
English H know let's talk in English it

8128
07:34:19,160 --> 07:34:22,000
will be of two benefits will be there

8129
07:34:22,000 --> 07:34:24,080
you'll be good you'll be good at your

8130
07:34:24,080 --> 07:34:26,478
English paper and you'll be doing good

8131
07:34:26,478 --> 07:34:30,280
in biology also is that

8132
07:34:32,610 --> 07:34:35,000
[Laughter]

8133
07:34:35,000 --> 07:34:38,040
it so we have a shire also here oh my

8134
07:34:38,040 --> 07:34:39,878
God we have a sh then gorov you should

8135
07:34:39,878 --> 07:34:41,520
write something for

8136
07:34:41,520 --> 07:34:43,440
us like these people they are

8137
07:34:43,440 --> 07:34:45,478
continuously spamming continuously I can

8138
07:34:45,478 --> 07:34:48,718
see it's it's a video who's uh I am live

8139
07:34:48,718 --> 07:34:53,398
from last 8 hours 7 7 8 hours or

8140
07:34:53,398 --> 07:34:56,200
something right almost 7 7 and a half

8141
07:34:56,200 --> 07:34:58,040
hours I'm here I'm continuously looking

8142
07:34:58,040 --> 07:35:00,000
at the chat and the these people are

8143
07:35:00,000 --> 07:35:01,760
just talking to each other these people

8144
07:35:01,760 --> 07:35:04,080
are like this there's some setting going

8145
07:35:04,080 --> 07:35:06,080
on hi good evening otaku how are you

8146
07:35:06,080 --> 07:35:08,280
good

8147
07:35:09,080 --> 07:35:14,760
evening yeah okay no no it's

8148
07:35:14,840 --> 07:35:19,680
okay yes yes G sh there should be a ID

8149
07:35:19,680 --> 07:35:22,200
right but it should be in English and it

8150
07:35:22,200 --> 07:35:24,798
should be decent if it it is not decent

8151
07:35:24,798 --> 07:35:29,240
that I'll not uh say anything I'll not

8152
07:35:29,240 --> 07:35:33,280
speak hi good evening how are

8153
07:35:38,090 --> 07:35:42,360
[Laughter]

8154
07:35:42,360 --> 07:35:46,120
you you must be Googling to get a uh

8155
07:35:46,120 --> 07:35:48,440
good no it's okay Anushka it's okay

8156
07:35:48,440 --> 07:35:49,520
Anushka

8157
07:35:49,520 --> 07:35:52,000
it's good

8158
07:35:56,080 --> 07:35:58,398
now what is

8159
07:35:58,398 --> 07:36:01,398
this

8160
07:36:01,920 --> 07:36:06,680
okay okay I guess our Sher is busy in

8161
07:36:06,680 --> 07:36:09,080
Googling so better we should focus on

8162
07:36:09,080 --> 07:36:11,520
your studies

8163
07:36:11,520 --> 07:36:16,878
H H okay no no no it's no it's not fine

8164
07:36:16,878 --> 07:36:19,200
please huh do not spam here better to go

8165
07:36:19,200 --> 07:36:22,160
somewhere and

8166
07:36:22,160 --> 07:36:25,840
uh yeah

8167
07:36:31,080 --> 07:36:33,878
okay oh good if you belong to harana I

8168
07:36:33,878 --> 07:36:37,000
also belong to harana now allergy is due

8169
07:36:37,000 --> 07:36:39,398
to release of chemicals like histamine

8170
07:36:39,398 --> 07:36:42,120
and serotonin from mast cell and what is

8171
07:36:42,120 --> 07:36:45,440
histamine histamine is a

8172
07:36:45,440 --> 07:36:47,000
vasodilator

8173
07:36:47,000 --> 07:36:50,478
vasodilator so vasod Vaso means blood

8174
07:36:50,478 --> 07:36:53,120
vessel dilator mean to dilate the blood

8175
07:36:53,120 --> 07:36:57,638
blood vessel serotonin is Vaso

8176
07:37:02,000 --> 07:37:04,478
constrictor right for determination and

8177
07:37:04,478 --> 07:37:06,280
cause of allergy the patient is exposed

8178
07:37:06,280 --> 07:37:08,160
or injected to various small doses of

8179
07:37:08,160 --> 07:37:09,840
possible allergy and with that we can

8180
07:37:09,840 --> 07:37:13,360
get to know

8181
07:37:13,798 --> 07:37:19,360
okay okay now let's move further aut

8182
07:37:19,360 --> 07:37:22,360
autoimmunity now autoimmunity sometime

8183
07:37:22,360 --> 07:37:24,718
due to genetic and other unknown reason

8184
07:37:24,718 --> 07:37:27,360
the body start attacking our own body

8185
07:37:27,360 --> 07:37:30,478
cell considering that it a path pathogen

8186
07:37:30,478 --> 07:37:32,000
so they cause some diseases which is

8187
07:37:32,000 --> 07:37:33,920
autoimmune diseases one example is given

8188
07:37:33,920 --> 07:37:37,958
over here that is a uh uh

8189
07:37:37,958 --> 07:37:40,318
arthritis clear which is a rtid

8190
07:37:40,318 --> 07:37:42,760
arthritis so in the joints we have

8191
07:37:42,760 --> 07:37:45,398
sinovial membrane so our body start

8192
07:37:45,398 --> 07:37:47,080
producing antibodies against that

8193
07:37:47,080 --> 07:37:49,680
membrane so that becomes affected and

8194
07:37:49,680 --> 07:37:51,080
that there's an inflammation due to

8195
07:37:51,080 --> 07:37:54,478
which we fail we feel pain right while

8196
07:37:54,478 --> 07:37:58,240
uh you know moving our hands and the

8197
07:37:59,160 --> 07:38:01,760
joints if you're in eth standard if you

8198
07:38:01,760 --> 07:38:03,160
will be in 10th standard then you can

8199
07:38:03,160 --> 07:38:05,718
attm the

8200
07:38:06,520 --> 07:38:08,040
session

8201
07:38:08,040 --> 07:38:12,200
okay now moving on to the next immune

8202
07:38:12,200 --> 07:38:14,200
system in our body so like I have told

8203
07:38:14,200 --> 07:38:16,798
you B cells are there t cells are there

8204
07:38:16,798 --> 07:38:18,760
now let's talk about the whole system

8205
07:38:18,760 --> 07:38:20,798
what all things are the part of this

8206
07:38:20,798 --> 07:38:23,878
let's have a look now human immune

8207
07:38:23,878 --> 07:38:26,680
system consist of lymphoid organ tissues

8208
07:38:26,680 --> 07:38:30,080
cells and some molecules like antibodies

8209
07:38:30,080 --> 07:38:32,440
organs are there lipoid organs are there

8210
07:38:32,440 --> 07:38:34,160
in our body let's talk about the

8211
07:38:34,160 --> 07:38:36,120
lymphoid organs we have tissues also

8212
07:38:36,120 --> 07:38:38,360
cells so we have already discussed now

8213
07:38:38,360 --> 07:38:40,040
what are the lymphoid organs these are

8214
07:38:40,040 --> 07:38:42,360
the organs where original maturation

8215
07:38:42,360 --> 07:38:44,478
proliferation of

8216
07:38:44,478 --> 07:38:47,398
lymphocytes lymphocytes are your B and T

8217
07:38:47,398 --> 07:38:50,280
lymphocytes the primary lymphoid organs

8218
07:38:50,280 --> 07:38:53,160
are the bone marrow and the thymus so

8219
07:38:53,160 --> 07:38:55,200
primary lymphoid organ are those organ

8220
07:38:55,200 --> 07:38:57,638
where there is maturation and

8221
07:38:57,638 --> 07:38:59,878
proliferation of

8222
07:38:59,878 --> 07:39:02,160
lymphocytoid and the T lymy these are

8223
07:39:02,160 --> 07:39:04,680
your bone marrow and the

8224
07:39:04,680 --> 07:39:08,920
thymus right now after maturation the B

8225
07:39:08,920 --> 07:39:10,840
lymphocytoid organ and secondary

8226
07:39:10,840 --> 07:39:13,440
lymphoid organs are those organ where

8227
07:39:13,440 --> 07:39:17,040
there is interaction

8228
07:39:17,040 --> 07:39:19,478
of interaction

8229
07:39:19,478 --> 07:39:21,200
of

8230
07:39:21,200 --> 07:39:22,760
antigen

8231
07:39:22,760 --> 07:39:25,120
with

8232
07:39:25,120 --> 07:39:28,080
antibodies clear here the examples are

8233
07:39:28,080 --> 07:39:30,878
spleen lymph node tonsil spare patches

8234
07:39:30,878 --> 07:39:33,318
of small intestine and appendix so you

8235
07:39:33,318 --> 07:39:34,718
should know again I'm saying the

8236
07:39:34,718 --> 07:39:38,040
difference between these two the primary

8237
07:39:38,040 --> 07:39:39,398
lymphoid organ and the secondary

8238
07:39:39,398 --> 07:39:41,360
lymphoid organ primary lymphoid organ

8239
07:39:41,360 --> 07:39:43,718
are your bone Maro thymus secondary

8240
07:39:43,718 --> 07:39:47,040
lymphoid organs are your pairs patches

8241
07:39:47,040 --> 07:39:49,638
appendix malt G

8242
07:39:49,638 --> 07:39:51,638
Etc

8243
07:39:51,638 --> 07:39:54,360
okay

8244
07:39:54,360 --> 07:39:57,200
now secondary lymphoid organ provide the

8245
07:39:57,200 --> 07:39:59,200
site of interaction of

8246
07:39:59,200 --> 07:40:01,840
lymphocytic which undergo proliferation

8247
07:40:01,840 --> 07:40:04,040
to become eector cell so at the

8248
07:40:04,040 --> 07:40:06,638
secondary one there's an U this one

8249
07:40:06,638 --> 07:40:08,958
right interaction bone marrow is a main

8250
07:40:08,958 --> 07:40:11,760
lymphoid one where the all blood cell

8251
07:40:11,760 --> 07:40:13,878
including the lympho are produced please

8252
07:40:13,878 --> 07:40:17,000
remember this line either you are a cbsc

8253
07:40:17,000 --> 07:40:18,798
aspirant or no neat aspirant please

8254
07:40:18,798 --> 07:40:20,798
remember this bone marrow is a place

8255
07:40:20,798 --> 07:40:23,558
where either it is WBC RBC everything

8256
07:40:23,558 --> 07:40:27,000
formation occur in the bone marrow clear

8257
07:40:27,000 --> 07:40:30,200
thymus is quite large at Birth but once

8258
07:40:30,200 --> 07:40:34,600
we get old their size reduces thymus and

8259
07:40:34,600 --> 07:40:37,160
this is a place where the T lymphocytes

8260
07:40:37,160 --> 07:40:41,160
mature formation of T

8261
07:40:43,798 --> 07:40:45,878
lymphocysts all the cells of formation

8262
07:40:45,878 --> 07:40:47,878
occur in the bone marrow but their

8263
07:40:47,878 --> 07:40:50,160
maturation T lymy maturation occur in

8264
07:40:50,160 --> 07:40:51,160
the

8265
07:40:51,160 --> 07:40:53,680
thymus now bone marrow and thymus

8266
07:40:53,680 --> 07:40:55,798
provide micro environment for the

8267
07:40:55,798 --> 07:40:57,680
development maturation of T lymphocytes

8268
07:40:57,680 --> 07:40:59,478
spleen has a reservoir of erthrocytes

8269
07:40:59,478 --> 07:41:02,478
now another super important one marker

8270
07:41:02,478 --> 07:41:05,120
mucosa Associated lymphoid tissue

8271
07:41:05,120 --> 07:41:07,638
located within the lining of wheresoever

8272
07:41:07,638 --> 07:41:09,200
mucosa is there either it is in a

8273
07:41:09,200 --> 07:41:11,360
digestive tract it is there in the

8274
07:41:11,360 --> 07:41:15,680
respiratory tract urinogenital tract it

8275
07:41:15,680 --> 07:41:20,478
contribute 50% of the lymphoid tissues

8276
07:41:20,478 --> 07:41:23,240
in our body very very very

8277
07:41:23,240 --> 07:41:25,600
important primary lymphoid organ

8278
07:41:25,600 --> 07:41:27,760
secondary lymphoid organ difference can

8279
07:41:27,760 --> 07:41:30,798
be asked in your paper clear now primary

8280
07:41:30,798 --> 07:41:33,520
lymphoid organ bone maryus here we have

8281
07:41:33,520 --> 07:41:35,760
others and The Malt is the one mucosa

8282
07:41:35,760 --> 07:41:38,558
associate lymphoid tissue is the one

8283
07:41:38,558 --> 07:41:42,878
where which is which constitute almost

8284
07:41:42,878 --> 07:41:44,878
50%

8285
07:41:44,878 --> 07:41:48,478
okay let's stop shiring beta stop stop

8286
07:41:48,478 --> 07:41:52,520
do doing this now we have to start the

8287
07:41:52,520 --> 07:41:55,920
topic eights okay let me bring some

8288
07:41:55,920 --> 07:41:59,558
water okay I need a water let me bring

8289
07:41:59,558 --> 07:42:01,160
some water I don't have water where's my

8290
07:42:01,160 --> 07:42:04,160
bottle let me bring some water I'll be

8291
07:42:04,160 --> 07:42:06,318
back okay it's not a break I'm just

8292
07:42:06,318 --> 07:42:10,318
coming we have to start the topic of

8293
07:42:17,360 --> 07:42:20,360
AIDS

8294
07:43:17,318 --> 07:43:18,798
yes we are back

8295
07:43:18,798 --> 07:43:22,478
I'm back okay so let's start AIDS what

8296
07:43:22,478 --> 07:43:26,878
is AIDS AIDS is

8297
07:43:27,760 --> 07:43:30,760
acquired

8298
07:43:32,080 --> 07:43:35,080
immuno

8299
07:43:36,840 --> 07:43:39,840
deficiency

8300
07:43:42,360 --> 07:43:44,840
syndrome acquired immun deficiency

8301
07:43:44,840 --> 07:43:49,440
syndrome what is the causitive agent

8302
07:43:49,440 --> 07:43:52,360
it's the

8303
07:43:52,680 --> 07:43:59,280
HIV it is the HIV human imuno deficiency

8304
07:44:12,120 --> 07:44:16,398
virus human imuno deficiency virus

8305
07:44:16,398 --> 07:44:23,200
HIV right the first case came in

8306
07:44:23,200 --> 07:44:26,478
1981 first

8307
07:44:26,478 --> 07:44:30,600
case and in the time period of 25 years

8308
07:44:30,600 --> 07:44:34,318
25 million people they suffer from this

8309
07:44:34,318 --> 07:44:36,878
this is because of a virus the firsta uh

8310
07:44:36,878 --> 07:44:39,318
disease come over here so let's talk

8311
07:44:39,318 --> 07:44:41,760
about AIDS so how does AIDS spread

8312
07:44:41,760 --> 07:44:44,280
eights spread by the you all know we

8313
07:44:44,280 --> 07:44:46,718
have done that chapter it's spread by

8314
07:44:46,718 --> 07:44:50,080
sexual contact

8315
07:44:50,760 --> 07:44:53,878
spread by

8316
07:44:53,878 --> 07:44:56,878
sexual

8317
07:44:58,840 --> 07:45:01,240
contact surgical

8318
07:45:01,240 --> 07:45:04,040
instruments same surgical

8319
07:45:04,040 --> 07:45:07,040
instruments

8320
07:45:07,840 --> 07:45:11,680
unsterilized sharing of

8321
07:45:13,840 --> 07:45:16,558
needles right so like this way and it

8322
07:45:16,558 --> 07:45:18,798
also spread from the

8323
07:45:18,798 --> 07:45:20,200
uh you

8324
07:45:20,200 --> 07:45:23,398
know mother to

8325
07:45:23,398 --> 07:45:27,318
fetus mother to

8326
07:45:28,120 --> 07:45:33,080
fetus it also spread by blood

8327
07:45:37,760 --> 07:45:40,000
transfusion blood

8328
07:45:40,000 --> 07:45:42,760
transfusion here this is eight acquired

8329
07:45:42,760 --> 07:45:45,440
imuno deficiency syndrome so this is

8330
07:45:45,440 --> 07:45:48,638
caused by virus now let's study how this

8331
07:45:48,638 --> 07:45:51,398
virus spread with the help of this chart

8332
07:45:51,398 --> 07:45:55,080
now we will learn everything clear now

8333
07:45:55,080 --> 07:45:58,240
HIV so what happens is if you look at

8334
07:45:58,240 --> 07:46:01,000
this virus can you see this virus so

8335
07:46:01,000 --> 07:46:04,160
this virus is a retro virus we call this

8336
07:46:04,160 --> 07:46:06,160
as a retrovirus why do we call this as a

8337
07:46:06,160 --> 07:46:10,160
retrovirus because this is having

8338
07:46:10,160 --> 07:46:13,878
RNA as genome and along with that they

8339
07:46:13,878 --> 07:46:16,760
are having two single stranded RNA they

8340
07:46:16,760 --> 07:46:19,478
have two single stranded RNA along with

8341
07:46:19,478 --> 07:46:21,398
that they are having reverse

8342
07:46:21,398 --> 07:46:24,000
transcriptase

8343
07:46:24,000 --> 07:46:27,638
enzyme reverse

8344
07:46:29,040 --> 07:46:32,840
transcriptase they have

8345
07:46:32,958 --> 07:46:36,840
proteas protees enzyme and they have

8346
07:46:36,840 --> 07:46:39,680
integr

8347
07:46:40,120 --> 07:46:42,558
enzyme these are the three enzymes which

8348
07:46:42,558 --> 07:46:44,638
are present in them they are having two

8349
07:46:44,638 --> 07:46:48,280
single standard RNA they have enzyme

8350
07:46:48,280 --> 07:46:51,040
like uh reverse transcriptase they have

8351
07:46:51,040 --> 07:46:54,680
a proteas or integr

8352
07:46:55,240 --> 07:46:58,798
clear this is a virus and on the virus

8353
07:46:58,798 --> 07:47:03,120
body spikes are present GP glycoprotein

8354
07:47:03,120 --> 07:47:07,040
gp1 120 and GP

8355
07:47:08,080 --> 07:47:11,280
41 so they are having this

8356
07:47:11,280 --> 07:47:15,958
GP 120 and this one is made up of

8357
07:47:15,958 --> 07:47:18,760
glycoprotein 41

8358
07:47:18,760 --> 07:47:23,680
they are having two capsid made up of

8359
07:47:25,920 --> 07:47:28,080
protein two

8360
07:47:28,080 --> 07:47:32,638
capsids they have one second two single

8361
07:47:32,638 --> 07:47:34,798
standard

8362
07:47:34,798 --> 07:47:41,478
RNA right single stranded RNA two two

8363
07:47:41,478 --> 07:47:43,760
and enzymes are also there three enzymes

8364
07:47:43,760 --> 07:47:45,638
I've already written there so these are

8365
07:47:45,638 --> 07:47:49,638
the three enzymes which they have

8366
07:47:49,638 --> 07:47:52,520
clear is this clear now with the help of

8367
07:47:52,520 --> 07:47:54,200
this GP

8368
07:47:54,200 --> 07:47:57,478
120 they whenever they ENT in our body

8369
07:47:57,478 --> 07:48:01,478
they bind to a cell animal

8370
07:48:01,478 --> 07:48:05,958
cell so this cell is a

8371
07:48:06,520 --> 07:48:08,120
macras

8372
07:48:08,120 --> 07:48:13,240
macras on the macras body the CD4

8373
07:48:13,240 --> 07:48:16,920
receptors are present CD4 what are these

8374
07:48:16,920 --> 07:48:21,000
CD4 four receptors so on the CD4

8375
07:48:21,000 --> 07:48:22,798
receptors they will come and they will

8376
07:48:22,798 --> 07:48:26,280
bind right with the help of gp1 120

8377
07:48:26,280 --> 07:48:28,240
receptors it's not shown over here but

8378
07:48:28,240 --> 07:48:30,478
detail I am showing you clear they will

8379
07:48:30,478 --> 07:48:32,200
come and they will bind over here now

8380
07:48:32,200 --> 07:48:35,718
this is a nucleus sorry this is a cell

8381
07:48:35,718 --> 07:48:38,200
now what will happen they will they will

8382
07:48:38,200 --> 07:48:41,680
release the RNA into the cell now what

8383
07:48:41,680 --> 07:48:43,840
will they do the viral D this will they

8384
07:48:43,840 --> 07:48:47,920
will release the viral RNA now viral RNA

8385
07:48:47,920 --> 07:48:50,798
will be having the integr

8386
07:48:50,798 --> 07:48:53,920
enzyme clear now what will happen this

8387
07:48:53,920 --> 07:48:57,200
RNA will form the DNA with the help of

8388
07:48:57,200 --> 07:48:59,120
integr enzyme they will go and

8389
07:48:59,120 --> 07:49:02,200
incorporate into the nucleus or the

8390
07:49:02,200 --> 07:49:05,520
Genome of the cell they will introduce

8391
07:49:05,520 --> 07:49:07,520
now what will happen they will use the

8392
07:49:07,520 --> 07:49:09,680
machinery and they will prepare a copy

8393
07:49:09,680 --> 07:49:12,398
of it multiple virus copies will be

8394
07:49:12,398 --> 07:49:14,958
produced now this macrophase it will be

8395
07:49:14,958 --> 07:49:19,718
termed as a factory of HIV

8396
07:49:19,840 --> 07:49:22,958
Factory of

8397
07:49:23,040 --> 07:49:26,638
HIV this is a factory of HIV now what

8398
07:49:26,638 --> 07:49:29,600
will do it will go and it will infect

8399
07:49:29,600 --> 07:49:33,360
the cell it will reduce the T helper

8400
07:49:33,360 --> 07:49:37,080
cell number which is more than 1200 and

8401
07:49:37,080 --> 07:49:40,520
in HIV patient it goes less than 200 now

8402
07:49:40,520 --> 07:49:42,040
what will happen to

8403
07:49:42,040 --> 07:49:43,958
patient patient will suffer from

8404
07:49:43,958 --> 07:49:46,878
Toxoplasma infection will suffer from a

8405
07:49:46,878 --> 07:49:49,920
common code tuberculosis and whatnot

8406
07:49:49,920 --> 07:49:52,398
because person is imuno compromised

8407
07:49:52,398 --> 07:49:55,360
people do not die because of

8408
07:49:55,360 --> 07:49:59,080
AIDS sorry the HIV people die because of

8409
07:49:59,080 --> 07:50:01,120
other disease because it's a syndrome

8410
07:50:01,120 --> 07:50:03,840
it's a collection of disease so other

8411
07:50:03,840 --> 07:50:05,680
diseases they will also come there will

8412
07:50:05,680 --> 07:50:07,920
be cancer development because cancer can

8413
07:50:07,920 --> 07:50:09,638
also be because of the virus I'll show

8414
07:50:09,638 --> 07:50:12,520
you there are onco viruses also that can

8415
07:50:12,520 --> 07:50:14,638
cause V that can cause cancer so that

8416
07:50:14,638 --> 07:50:16,638
can also occur in

8417
07:50:16,638 --> 07:50:20,360
them you know and the first HIV case

8418
07:50:20,360 --> 07:50:22,558
that I've discussed over there was like

8419
07:50:22,558 --> 07:50:24,520
in 1981 so there were group of

8420
07:50:24,520 --> 07:50:26,080
homosexuals and they were sitting and

8421
07:50:26,080 --> 07:50:28,878
they were using some drug so there was a

8422
07:50:28,878 --> 07:50:30,878
some party going on and they were using

8423
07:50:30,878 --> 07:50:33,600
some drug and that drug was they were in

8424
07:50:33,600 --> 07:50:35,600
inserting intravenously and they were

8425
07:50:35,600 --> 07:50:37,398
using the same syringe and after some

8426
07:50:37,398 --> 07:50:39,040
time all of them they were detected with

8427
07:50:39,040 --> 07:50:41,638
the same diseases they were having some

8428
07:50:41,638 --> 07:50:43,318
cancer they were they developed the

8429
07:50:43,318 --> 07:50:44,798
tuberculosis so doctors they were

8430
07:50:44,798 --> 07:50:46,398
worried why this happened so everybody

8431
07:50:46,398 --> 07:50:48,240
thought maybe it was because

8432
07:50:48,240 --> 07:50:53,478
of uh you know of the less uh you know

8433
07:50:53,478 --> 07:50:56,558
the immune system was not that uh one

8434
07:50:56,558 --> 07:50:59,080
like not that you know functional so

8435
07:50:59,080 --> 07:51:01,360
they realized doctor said this but the

8436
07:51:01,360 --> 07:51:03,840
major reason behind the compromised

8437
07:51:03,840 --> 07:51:07,040
immune system was this

8438
07:51:07,440 --> 07:51:09,440
virus

8439
07:51:09,440 --> 07:51:13,318
okay now so how can we uh red how can we

8440
07:51:13,318 --> 07:51:17,798
uh remove this we have a um uh viral uh

8441
07:51:17,798 --> 07:51:20,718
retroviral drugs available in the market

8442
07:51:20,718 --> 07:51:23,558
Andro retro drugs are there which

8443
07:51:23,558 --> 07:51:26,080
increase the longivity of a person but

8444
07:51:26,080 --> 07:51:29,920
complete eradication is again not

8445
07:51:30,000 --> 07:51:32,440
possible now let's talk about the next

8446
07:51:32,440 --> 07:51:34,240
disease which is a cancer then we have

8447
07:51:34,240 --> 07:51:37,520
to do drugs and that's it we are done

8448
07:51:37,520 --> 07:51:41,920
yes now let's do cancer right cancer

8449
07:51:41,920 --> 07:51:46,478
cancer is normal

8450
07:51:46,478 --> 07:51:52,040
cell converted into a cancer

8451
07:51:53,958 --> 07:51:58,240
cell right normal cell has a capacity

8452
07:51:58,240 --> 07:52:01,280
that it

8453
07:52:02,798 --> 07:52:04,600
show

8454
07:52:04,600 --> 07:52:07,958
growth and

8455
07:52:10,360 --> 07:52:13,398
apoptosis apoptosis apoptosis is

8456
07:52:13,398 --> 07:52:16,200
programmed cell death some these cells

8457
07:52:16,200 --> 07:52:17,638
every cells they have some program

8458
07:52:17,638 --> 07:52:20,798
programming they divide and after some

8459
07:52:20,798 --> 07:52:24,040
time they die whereas the cancer cells

8460
07:52:24,040 --> 07:52:26,440
no

8461
07:52:26,680 --> 07:52:30,280
apoptosis epop

8462
07:52:30,280 --> 07:52:33,520
Tois these are the one which respond to

8463
07:52:33,520 --> 07:52:35,920
growth

8464
07:52:36,478 --> 07:52:39,920
factors respond to

8465
07:52:39,920 --> 07:52:42,920
growth

8466
07:52:44,878 --> 07:52:47,840
factors they are the one who do do not

8467
07:52:47,840 --> 07:52:50,878
respond to growth

8468
07:52:58,718 --> 07:53:01,680
factor do not respond to growth factors

8469
07:53:01,680 --> 07:53:04,958
they do not respond okay they will not

8470
07:53:04,958 --> 07:53:07,240
respond to the growth factors so they

8471
07:53:07,240 --> 07:53:10,120
will keep on dividing so they divide

8472
07:53:10,120 --> 07:53:15,120
rapidly so they show controlled

8473
07:53:15,680 --> 07:53:19,360
division controlled

8474
07:53:19,558 --> 07:53:23,280
division they do not show controlled

8475
07:53:23,280 --> 07:53:27,398
division so there is uncontrolled

8476
07:53:28,000 --> 07:53:32,080
division uncontrolled

8477
07:53:33,318 --> 07:53:35,840
division these are the cancer cells

8478
07:53:35,840 --> 07:53:37,718
cancer cells this is a property the

8479
07:53:37,718 --> 07:53:38,958
difference between a normal cell and the

8480
07:53:38,958 --> 07:53:42,040
cancer cell now these cancer cell please

8481
07:53:42,040 --> 07:53:45,360
have a look as they show uncontrolled

8482
07:53:45,360 --> 07:53:48,318
division right because some changes

8483
07:53:48,318 --> 07:53:50,600
occur in a normal cell due to which that

8484
07:53:50,600 --> 07:53:53,558
cell gets converted into a cancer cell

8485
07:53:53,558 --> 07:53:55,718
so this occur because of the various

8486
07:53:55,718 --> 07:53:58,920
things now let's talk about the factors

8487
07:53:58,920 --> 07:54:01,798
by which it is converted so there are

8488
07:54:01,798 --> 07:54:06,280
first thing let's talk about the

8489
07:54:08,280 --> 07:54:10,958
radiations so because of the radiation

8490
07:54:10,958 --> 07:54:12,878
this changes

8491
07:54:12,878 --> 07:54:15,718
occur these radiation can be your

8492
07:54:15,718 --> 07:54:19,840
ionizing radiation and non ionizing

8493
07:54:21,558 --> 07:54:24,680
radiation ionizing

8494
07:54:24,680 --> 07:54:29,440
radiation or non ionizing

8495
07:54:41,000 --> 07:54:43,440
radiation right ionizing radiation your

8496
07:54:43,440 --> 07:54:46,920
xrays non other rays are also there now

8497
07:54:46,920 --> 07:54:49,120
let's talk about UV rays are also one of

8498
07:54:49,120 --> 07:54:53,440
them so now what all things there can be

8499
07:54:53,440 --> 07:54:57,840
viral onogen sorry enco

8500
07:54:57,840 --> 07:55:03,718
virus enco virus are there the

8501
07:55:03,718 --> 07:55:07,318
smoke whatever like we smoke right so

8502
07:55:07,318 --> 07:55:09,080
that is also one of the Reason by which

8503
07:55:09,080 --> 07:55:11,160
the cancer can happen so this these are

8504
07:55:11,160 --> 07:55:13,638
the reasons behind it now what does

8505
07:55:13,638 --> 07:55:18,478
these things causes now these two

8506
07:55:18,478 --> 07:55:23,000
can lead to this particular

8507
07:55:23,000 --> 07:55:27,840
conversion they lead to gain of

8508
07:55:30,280 --> 07:55:37,878
function gain of function in proto onco

8509
07:55:39,558 --> 07:55:44,760
Gene due to which they're converted into

8510
07:55:46,120 --> 07:55:48,318
onoin

8511
07:55:48,318 --> 07:55:52,398
they can lead to loss of

8512
07:55:52,398 --> 07:55:56,200
function loss of

8513
07:55:57,318 --> 07:55:58,840
function

8514
07:55:58,840 --> 07:56:03,160
in tumor suppressor

8515
07:56:06,000 --> 07:56:09,760
Gene tumor suppressor Gene due to which

8516
07:56:09,760 --> 07:56:12,280
there will be no tumor suppression if

8517
07:56:12,280 --> 07:56:14,200
there is no tumor suppression just

8518
07:56:14,200 --> 07:56:16,558
imagine guys if there is no tumor

8519
07:56:16,558 --> 07:56:18,558
suppression so there will be development

8520
07:56:18,558 --> 07:56:23,718
of a tumor isn't it yes guys so ionizing

8521
07:56:23,718 --> 07:56:26,040
radiation non ionizing radiation these

8522
07:56:26,040 --> 07:56:29,440
all are the one which causes this

8523
07:56:29,440 --> 07:56:32,000
problem right now let's talk about

8524
07:56:32,000 --> 07:56:34,520
ionizing yeah ionizing me you can take

8525
07:56:34,520 --> 07:56:37,318
an example of xrays gamma rays Etc this

8526
07:56:37,318 --> 07:56:39,240
to you know now you have already done

8527
07:56:39,240 --> 07:56:41,440
chemistry gamma

8528
07:56:41,440 --> 07:56:44,920
rays here here you have is a UV R so

8529
07:56:44,920 --> 07:56:47,798
they causes such problem

8530
07:56:47,798 --> 07:56:50,440
now normal cell converted into a cancer

8531
07:56:50,440 --> 07:56:55,240
cell so now let's talk about their

8532
07:56:55,600 --> 07:56:59,240
types types of

8533
07:56:59,240 --> 07:57:04,958
cancer they are of two type one is

8534
07:57:04,958 --> 07:57:08,878
benig benig

8535
07:57:09,920 --> 07:57:13,558
tumor pagal tumor that is

8536
07:57:13,558 --> 07:57:16,360
localized localized means it is present

8537
07:57:16,360 --> 07:57:18,680
at a particular location it is present

8538
07:57:18,680 --> 07:57:21,160
at a particular location so it is

8539
07:57:21,160 --> 07:57:25,200
localized second thing is

8540
07:57:27,200 --> 07:57:31,000
malignant malignant means now the

8541
07:57:31,000 --> 07:57:34,958
cells are

8542
07:57:35,240 --> 07:57:38,240
spreading

8543
07:57:39,958 --> 07:57:42,160
from spreading

8544
07:57:42,160 --> 07:57:45,920
from one organ to

8545
07:57:45,920 --> 07:57:48,920
another

8546
07:57:49,398 --> 07:57:51,680
to

8547
07:57:51,878 --> 07:57:55,398
another right now in the benan state it

8548
07:57:55,398 --> 07:57:57,718
becomes very easy to eradicate but in

8549
07:57:57,718 --> 07:57:59,680
malignancy stage it's very difficult to

8550
07:57:59,680 --> 07:58:01,280
eradicate because it has affected other

8551
07:58:01,280 --> 07:58:04,040
organs so what all properties does a

8552
07:58:04,040 --> 07:58:07,160
cancer cell show because it is migrated

8553
07:58:07,160 --> 07:58:09,200
so here they will

8554
07:58:09,200 --> 07:58:12,200
show

8555
07:58:12,280 --> 07:58:14,760
angiogenesis they show

8556
07:58:14,760 --> 07:58:17,120
angiogenesis angiogenesis means means

8557
07:58:17,120 --> 07:58:19,878
blood vessel

8558
07:58:21,200 --> 07:58:24,318
formation so that they can

8559
07:58:24,318 --> 07:58:27,958
get lot of

8560
07:58:29,280 --> 07:58:33,958
nutrient and do not show contact

8561
07:58:42,280 --> 07:58:45,160
inhibition

8562
07:58:45,160 --> 07:58:47,760
inhibition they do not show contact

8563
07:58:47,760 --> 07:58:50,080
inhibition so that means contact

8564
07:58:50,080 --> 07:58:52,040
inhibition is that

8565
07:58:52,040 --> 07:58:56,638
way by which one cell affect another so

8566
07:58:56,638 --> 07:58:58,798
how can we detect it this can be

8567
07:58:58,798 --> 07:59:01,360
detected by you know the bone marrow

8568
07:59:01,360 --> 07:59:05,798
test biopsy histopathogical

8569
07:59:05,958 --> 07:59:09,398
studies here I'm

8570
07:59:10,920 --> 07:59:12,440
writing

8571
07:59:12,440 --> 07:59:14,280
detected

8572
07:59:14,280 --> 07:59:15,840
by

8573
07:59:15,840 --> 07:59:18,840
biopsy

8574
07:59:24,840 --> 07:59:27,558
hiso

8575
07:59:27,558 --> 07:59:29,280
pathological

8576
07:59:29,280 --> 07:59:31,878
studies and bone

8577
07:59:31,878 --> 07:59:34,398
marrow suppose blood test also with the

8578
07:59:34,398 --> 07:59:36,040
help of blood test also when it is

8579
07:59:36,040 --> 07:59:38,478
related to the cancer blood cancer

8580
07:59:38,478 --> 07:59:41,558
because in blood cancer the wbc's number

8581
07:59:41,558 --> 07:59:45,600
increases Beyond a limit so blood

8582
07:59:45,600 --> 07:59:48,718
test and and detected

8583
07:59:48,718 --> 07:59:51,718
or

8584
07:59:54,200 --> 07:59:56,878
treatment various therapies are there

8585
07:59:56,878 --> 07:59:58,638
one is

8586
07:59:58,638 --> 08:00:03,240
surgery if it is localized easy to

8587
08:00:03,280 --> 08:00:05,920
remove

8588
08:00:05,920 --> 08:00:08,120
ionizing

8589
08:00:08,120 --> 08:00:11,120
sorry

8590
08:00:15,478 --> 08:00:18,520
immunotherapy is is there radiotherapy

8591
08:00:18,520 --> 08:00:20,798
is

8592
08:00:21,958 --> 08:00:25,200
there radiotherapy is there and Alpha

8593
08:00:25,200 --> 08:00:27,718
interferons also we are working in this

8594
08:00:27,718 --> 08:00:29,440
direction hope a good revision is

8595
08:00:29,440 --> 08:00:31,760
happening Alpha

8596
08:00:31,760 --> 08:00:34,360
interferon

8597
08:00:34,360 --> 08:00:37,718
immunotherapy right radiotherapy

8598
08:00:37,718 --> 08:00:41,878
Etc right radiations

8599
08:00:42,120 --> 08:00:45,920
also right so Alpha interference these

8600
08:00:45,920 --> 08:00:48,040
evoke are immune system and they evoke

8601
08:00:48,040 --> 08:00:49,798
our immune system so that our body they

8602
08:00:49,798 --> 08:00:52,000
can start producing antibodies against

8603
08:00:52,000 --> 08:00:54,520
the cancer

8604
08:00:54,520 --> 08:00:56,240
cells

8605
08:00:56,240 --> 08:00:57,878
okay

8606
08:00:57,878 --> 08:01:01,958
so let's move further now let's talk

8607
08:01:01,958 --> 08:01:04,080
about the

8608
08:01:04,080 --> 08:01:09,000
drugs another topic of this chapter is

8609
08:01:10,318 --> 08:01:12,718
drug okay let's talk about of this

8610
08:01:12,718 --> 08:01:15,878
chapter drugs now what are drugs drugs

8611
08:01:15,878 --> 08:01:18,240
are those those things which we take

8612
08:01:18,240 --> 08:01:20,440
externally normally these drugs they are

8613
08:01:20,440 --> 08:01:22,600
available in market for curing various

8614
08:01:22,600 --> 08:01:25,200
diseases so there are two categories of

8615
08:01:25,200 --> 08:01:30,000
this drugs one category of this drug is

8616
08:01:32,878 --> 08:01:37,080
psychotropic and second one is

8617
08:01:37,920 --> 08:01:40,718
psychodelic psychodelic is the one which

8618
08:01:40,718 --> 08:01:43,280
causes

8619
08:01:43,718 --> 08:01:46,120
hallucination altered thought

8620
08:01:46,120 --> 08:01:48,638
hallucination ation and some

8621
08:01:48,638 --> 08:01:51,520
psychotropic drugs are those drugs which

8622
08:01:51,520 --> 08:01:54,440
basically uh basically which are

8623
08:01:54,440 --> 08:01:56,878
sedative which will give you calm effect

8624
08:01:56,878 --> 08:01:59,280
sometime painkillers Etc so they will be

8625
08:01:59,280 --> 08:02:01,920
having this effect

8626
08:02:01,920 --> 08:02:04,478
sedative effect in some cases They Are

8627
08:02:04,478 --> 08:02:07,280
depressants

8628
08:02:07,280 --> 08:02:10,398
also depressant also so these are the

8629
08:02:10,398 --> 08:02:13,798
categories so here in the in this

8630
08:02:13,798 --> 08:02:18,558
category we have is

8631
08:02:19,360 --> 08:02:23,600
we have is uh you know what's the

8632
08:02:23,600 --> 08:02:26,600
name

8633
08:02:29,558 --> 08:02:32,558
tranquilizer tranquilizers come this

8634
08:02:32,558 --> 08:02:35,040
category tranquilizers are like benzo

8635
08:02:35,040 --> 08:02:38,718
dipine and uh your barbiturates they

8636
08:02:38,718 --> 08:02:41,040
come under this category they we have is

8637
08:02:41,040 --> 08:02:44,120
this uh

8638
08:02:45,478 --> 08:02:50,040
stimulants then we have is this

8639
08:02:55,040 --> 08:02:57,280
ofid opioids they come under this

8640
08:02:57,280 --> 08:02:59,000
category rest all they come under the

8641
08:02:59,000 --> 08:03:02,360
psychodelic drugs yeah psychotropic are

8642
08:03:02,360 --> 08:03:04,760
the sedative drugs you will be uh you

8643
08:03:04,760 --> 08:03:07,040
know it will give you a calmness effect

8644
08:03:07,040 --> 08:03:10,520
you will be calmed and the depressant it

8645
08:03:10,520 --> 08:03:14,718
has very bad impact in our body clear we

8646
08:03:14,718 --> 08:03:16,878
are talking about it now first is is

8647
08:03:16,878 --> 08:03:19,798
opioids now we are discussing one by one

8648
08:03:19,798 --> 08:03:22,080
first let's talk about opioids opioids

8649
08:03:22,080 --> 08:03:23,440
come under like I've told you

8650
08:03:23,440 --> 08:03:26,558
psychotropic drug psychotropic drugs are

8651
08:03:26,558 --> 08:03:29,600
those drugs which affects our body and

8652
08:03:29,600 --> 08:03:32,760
this gives a you know a sedative effect

8653
08:03:32,760 --> 08:03:36,360
a calmness effect and here The receptors

8654
08:03:36,360 --> 08:03:37,878
are present on the center nervous system

8655
08:03:37,878 --> 08:03:40,958
and gastrointestinal tract of opioids

8656
08:03:40,958 --> 08:03:43,558
they are taken from the poppy plant that

8657
08:03:43,558 --> 08:03:48,280
is a pomn ferum very important

8658
08:03:48,280 --> 08:03:50,120
right and this is extracted from the

8659
08:03:50,120 --> 08:03:54,478
latex latex of puppy plant now they are

8660
08:03:54,478 --> 08:03:57,000
taken by snotting and by injection here

8661
08:03:57,000 --> 08:03:59,680
the examples are morphine heroin smack

8662
08:03:59,680 --> 08:04:02,920
di atile Morphin so these are basically

8663
08:04:02,920 --> 08:04:06,040
used uh at earlier time when there were

8664
08:04:06,040 --> 08:04:08,558
there was a war war so people used to

8665
08:04:08,558 --> 08:04:11,760
take it you know when these people they

8666
08:04:11,760 --> 08:04:14,000
were in injured so at that time it was

8667
08:04:14,000 --> 08:04:16,160
used but nowadays people they've started

8668
08:04:16,160 --> 08:04:18,318
us using it they produce they think that

8669
08:04:18,318 --> 08:04:20,040
it produce a calmness effect it gives

8670
08:04:20,040 --> 08:04:22,440
them a good uh you know a Euphoria kind

8671
08:04:22,440 --> 08:04:24,318
of thing so they take it which is not

8672
08:04:24,318 --> 08:04:26,798
really which is very bad for our body it

8673
08:04:26,798 --> 08:04:28,718
is effective sedative

8674
08:04:28,718 --> 08:04:32,120
painkiller but I am saying that it is a

8675
08:04:32,120 --> 08:04:33,958
drug which because people they are not

8676
08:04:33,958 --> 08:04:37,718
using it as a painkiller now it is

8677
08:04:37,718 --> 08:04:40,040
undergo surgery it is used at that time

8678
08:04:40,040 --> 08:04:42,120
it is a depressant slow down the body

8679
08:04:42,120 --> 08:04:44,478
function it is orderless white bitter

8680
08:04:44,478 --> 08:04:47,040
crystalline compound this is a

8681
08:04:47,040 --> 08:04:49,920
opioids receptors are present in central

8682
08:04:49,920 --> 08:04:52,000
nervous system and the gastrointestinal

8683
08:04:52,000 --> 08:04:55,240
tract next is cannabinoids canabo

8684
08:04:55,240 --> 08:04:57,280
monoids receptors they are present in

8685
08:04:57,280 --> 08:05:01,240
brain now these are the one so it

8686
08:05:01,240 --> 08:05:03,398
activates our body you will be activated

8687
08:05:03,398 --> 08:05:04,958
once the person will take it they will

8688
08:05:04,958 --> 08:05:07,000
be activated activated means that this

8689
08:05:07,000 --> 08:05:09,798
increases the cardiovascular activity so

8690
08:05:09,798 --> 08:05:11,680
overall these are these are amongst

8691
08:05:11,680 --> 08:05:15,878
those drugs which are uh you know um

8692
08:05:15,878 --> 08:05:17,398
which are made mainly used by the sports

8693
08:05:17,398 --> 08:05:21,160
person right in fluoresence FL tops

8694
08:05:21,160 --> 08:05:24,600
leaves raisins of the cannabis plants

8695
08:05:24,600 --> 08:05:27,360
Canabis sativa inhalation by Oral

8696
08:05:27,360 --> 08:05:29,920
ingestion charas hashish ganja marijuana

8697
08:05:29,920 --> 08:05:31,840
comes under this category effects on

8698
08:05:31,840 --> 08:05:33,760
cardiovascular system of the body and

8699
08:05:33,760 --> 08:05:36,398
being abused by the sports

8700
08:05:36,398 --> 08:05:39,478
person yeah now

8701
08:05:39,478 --> 08:05:41,958
stimulants stimulants are the one which

8702
08:05:41,958 --> 08:05:43,958
stimulate our body so this also comes

8703
08:05:43,958 --> 08:05:46,360
under the category of psychotropic drugs

8704
08:05:46,360 --> 08:05:48,558
again I'm saying this is isolated from

8705
08:05:48,558 --> 08:05:51,440
the arthro xylm Coca coca plant coca

8706
08:05:51,440 --> 08:05:54,040
arthro zym coca here have you heard of

8707
08:05:54,040 --> 08:05:57,558
cocaine coca now if I talk about the

8708
08:05:57,558 --> 08:05:59,958
energy drinks you take in energy drinks

8709
08:05:59,958 --> 08:06:02,280
I won't take the name this is there so

8710
08:06:02,280 --> 08:06:05,440
it gives you that stimulant effect so

8711
08:06:05,440 --> 08:06:07,240
one should not take it because

8712
08:06:07,240 --> 08:06:09,718
dependency increases so it is taken by

8713
08:06:09,718 --> 08:06:12,638
snotting cocaine coca alkaloid commonly

8714
08:06:12,638 --> 08:06:14,718
called Coke or crack it interfere with

8715
08:06:14,718 --> 08:06:16,398
the transport of neurotransmitter

8716
08:06:16,398 --> 08:06:19,120
dopamine potent stimulant action of

8717
08:06:19,120 --> 08:06:20,840
Center n a system producing sense of

8718
08:06:20,840 --> 08:06:23,040
euphoria increased energy excessive

8719
08:06:23,040 --> 08:06:25,360
dosage can cause hallucinations

8720
08:06:25,360 --> 08:06:28,440
hallucinations is altered thought right

8721
08:06:28,440 --> 08:06:30,680
stimulants they stimulate it again I'm

8722
08:06:30,680 --> 08:06:33,520
saying do not be dependent you guys are

8723
08:06:33,520 --> 08:06:35,040

8728
08:06:43,798 --> 08:06:46,478
seriously not good for the body it

8729
08:06:46,478 --> 08:06:48,798
dependency increases with

8730
08:06:48,798 --> 08:06:52,000
time now first is next is hallucinogens

8731
08:06:52,000 --> 08:06:53,920

8732
08:06:53,920 --> 08:06:55,520

in the Puja whenever we worship we use

8738
08:07:07,638 --> 08:07:10,360
datura also so that is also a

8739
08:07:10,360 --> 08:07:12,840
hallucinogens that cause hallucinations

8740
08:07:12,840 --> 08:07:14,680
other drugs synthetic drugs available in

the market like barbituate and benzo

8742
08:07:17,160 --> 08:07:19,520
dipine barbituate and benzoin comes

mental illness for their calmness but

8747
08:07:28,798 --> 08:07:30,920
people now they have started using it

8748
08:07:30,920 --> 08:07:32,520
amphetamine they also comes under this

8749
08:07:32,520 --> 08:07:34,760
category they help patient cope up with

8750
08:07:34,760 --> 08:07:38,520
a mental illness like depression and

8751
08:07:38,760 --> 08:07:43,520
insomnia right clear and also guys when

8752
08:07:43,520 --> 08:07:45,798
uh here morphine is written do you know

8753
08:07:45,798 --> 08:07:47,718
uh when whenever we take cuff medicines

8754
08:07:47,718 --> 08:07:50,440
so we feel sleepy and it's on the back

8755
08:07:50,440 --> 08:07:52,520
side of a cuff syrup it is written one

8756
08:07:52,520 --> 08:07:54,160
should not drive after taking the cuff

8757
08:07:54,160 --> 08:07:56,360
syrup because that contains morphine so

8758
08:07:56,360 --> 08:07:59,280
it gives a calm effect it can uh induce

8759
08:07:59,280 --> 08:08:04,200
sleep also that is a reason

8760
08:08:04,200 --> 08:08:08,398
okay okay now let's talk about the

8761
08:08:08,398 --> 08:08:10,040
alcohol these are the problems related

8762
08:08:10,040 --> 08:08:12,280
to adolesence M next problem we have is

8763
08:08:12,280 --> 08:08:15,958
a alcohol alcohol what is the AL what is

8764
08:08:15,958 --> 08:08:17,478
what does alcohol do it increases the

8765
08:08:17,478 --> 08:08:20,718
body activity or it lowers the body

8766
08:08:20,718 --> 08:08:23,040
activity so what do you feel like after

8767
08:08:23,040 --> 08:08:24,200
taking

8768
08:08:24,200 --> 08:08:27,000
alcohol one should not take if you see

8769
08:08:27,000 --> 08:08:29,040
people when they take alcohol do they

8770
08:08:29,040 --> 08:08:30,840
become active or they

8771
08:08:30,840 --> 08:08:33,318
depress they become inactive so it

8772
08:08:33,318 --> 08:08:36,040
produces that you know sedative calmness

8773
08:08:36,040 --> 08:08:38,558
calmness effect it's a depressant yes it

8774
08:08:38,558 --> 08:08:41,680
slowers the body uh activities it

8775
08:08:41,680 --> 08:08:44,280
because it lowers the blood sugar level

8776
08:08:44,280 --> 08:08:46,600
so person thinking capacity is AFF Ed

8777
08:08:46,600 --> 08:08:49,520
blood May there will be less sugar going

8778
08:08:49,520 --> 08:08:51,600
alcohol drinking affect the cerebelum

8779
08:08:51,600 --> 08:08:53,040
part of the brain so control and

8780
08:08:53,040 --> 08:08:54,798
coordination is badly affected you know

8781
08:08:54,798 --> 08:08:56,520
the people they just they whenever they

8782
08:08:56,520 --> 08:08:58,440
take alcohol they just roam around they

8783
08:08:58,440 --> 08:09:00,478
do not have a body control when they're

8784
08:09:00,478 --> 08:09:01,958
not able to speak properly this is

8785
08:09:01,958 --> 08:09:05,160
because the cerebelum is

8786
08:09:05,160 --> 08:09:08,318
affected okay next yes it affects the

8787
08:09:08,318 --> 08:09:11,360
liver also excess alcohol in the yes it

8788
08:09:11,360 --> 08:09:13,478
affects the major organ which it affects

8789
08:09:13,478 --> 08:09:16,840
is the liver that you all know

8790
08:09:16,840 --> 08:09:18,878
so what happens in the liver is this

8791
08:09:18,878 --> 08:09:21,120
alcohol when someone takes it goes to

8792
08:09:21,120 --> 08:09:22,878
stomach from the stomach it will be

8793
08:09:22,878 --> 08:09:24,840
absorbed it will go directly to the

8794
08:09:24,840 --> 08:09:26,958
liver liver mate will be converted into

8795
08:09:26,958 --> 08:09:29,280
the fat so first stage will be the fatty

8796
08:09:29,280 --> 08:09:31,760
liver first stage will be the fatty

8797
08:09:31,760 --> 08:09:35,040
liver and it can affect the liver

8798
08:09:35,040 --> 08:09:37,120
because it can deposited uh the fat can

8799
08:09:37,120 --> 08:09:38,798
deposit into the liver cells and the

8800
08:09:38,798 --> 08:09:40,600
bile duct that can lead to the fatty

8801
08:09:40,600 --> 08:09:43,080
liver this is a first stage if people

8802
08:09:43,080 --> 08:09:46,160
take more like lot of alcohol this can

8803
08:09:46,160 --> 08:09:48,558
lead to the liver therosis liver sosis

8804
08:09:48,558 --> 08:09:51,600
means fibrous tissue formation and that

8805
08:09:51,600 --> 08:09:54,318
is a irreversible change in the liver if

8806
08:09:54,318 --> 08:09:56,680
someone is having fatty liver fatty

8807
08:09:56,680 --> 08:10:00,398
liver can be reversed right by removing

8808
08:10:00,398 --> 08:10:02,440
uh alcohol from their diet now next

8809
08:10:02,440 --> 08:10:04,558
thing is if liver fibrous tissue

8810
08:10:04,558 --> 08:10:07,040
formation occur liver curosis that is

8811
08:10:07,040 --> 08:10:08,958
not

8812
08:10:08,958 --> 08:10:10,478
curable

8813
08:10:10,478 --> 08:10:13,478
clear

8814
08:10:14,160 --> 08:10:18,160
now okay next is it can lead to loss of

8815
08:10:18,160 --> 08:10:20,638
memory cause the inflammation of wall of

8816
08:10:20,638 --> 08:10:24,120
stomach chronic cases ulcers can develop

8817
08:10:24,120 --> 08:10:26,478
overall body resistance against disease

8818
08:10:26,478 --> 08:10:28,200
that means our immune system is also

8819
08:10:28,200 --> 08:10:31,558
badly affected okay if someone at your

8820
08:10:31,558 --> 08:10:34,240
place anyone who takes alcohol this is

8821
08:10:34,240 --> 08:10:37,240
not good for the body in fact the those

8822
08:10:37,240 --> 08:10:38,638
drugs which I have discussed they are

8823
08:10:38,638 --> 08:10:41,000
also not good for the body and now let's

8824
08:10:41,000 --> 08:10:43,638
talk about the

8825
08:10:43,638 --> 08:10:46,760
smoking so smoking means tobacco so

8826
08:10:46,760 --> 08:10:49,840
tobacco can be taken in any form CH tell

8827
08:10:49,840 --> 08:10:52,280
me smoking or the tobacco when we talk

8828
08:10:52,280 --> 08:10:54,920
about the tobacco tobacco here nicotine

8829
08:10:54,920 --> 08:10:57,398
is present so it is a stimulant or it

8830
08:10:57,398 --> 08:10:59,200
suppress the

8831
08:10:59,200 --> 08:11:01,318
body tell

8832
08:11:01,318 --> 08:11:04,558
me tobacco it stimulates the body or it
